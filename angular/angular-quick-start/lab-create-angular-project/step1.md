# Setting up the Development Environment

Before you start, you'll need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Angular requires Node.js version 10.13 or later.

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   Visit [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system. This will also install npm.

2. **Install Angular CLI:**
   Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. Install it globally using npm:

   ```sh
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

   If you get an error during the installation process, add `sudo`.
