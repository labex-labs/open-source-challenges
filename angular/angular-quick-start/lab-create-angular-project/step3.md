# Serve the Application

Angular CLI provides a server, for you to build and serve your app locally.

```sh
ng serve --open
```

The `--open` (or just `-o`) option automatically opens your browser to `http://localhost:4200/`.

If you want to run on another port, you can use the following command to specify the port, for example, 8080.

```sh
ng serve --port 8080 --open
```
