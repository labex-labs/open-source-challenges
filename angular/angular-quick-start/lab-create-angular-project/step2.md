# Create a New Angular Project

Once you have Angular CLI installed, you can create a new Angular project using the following command:

```sh
ng new my-angular-app
```

This command will prompt you for information about features to include in the initial app project. You can accept the defaults for now.

After the installation process, change into the newly created project directory:

```sh
cd my-angular-app
```
