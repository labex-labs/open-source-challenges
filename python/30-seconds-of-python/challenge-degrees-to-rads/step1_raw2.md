# Degrees to Radians Challenge

## Introduction

In mathematics, angles can be measured in degrees or radians. Radians are the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics and physics. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a function that converts an angle from degrees to radians.

## Problem

Write a function `degrees_to_rads(deg)` that takes an angle in degrees as an argument and returns the angle in radians. Your function should use the following formula to convert degrees to radians:

```
radians = (degrees * pi) / 180.0
```

where `pi` is a constant value representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (approximately 3.14159).

Your function should return the angle in radians rounded to 4 decimal places.

## Example

```py
degrees_to_rads(180) # returns 3.1416
degrees_to_rads(90) # returns 1.5708
degrees_to_rads(45) # returns 0.7854
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to convert an angle from degrees to radians using the formula `radians = (degrees * pi) / 180.0`. You have also written a function that implements this formula and returns the angle in radians rounded to 4 decimal places.
