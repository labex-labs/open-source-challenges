# List Intersection Based on Function

In Python, we can find the intersection of two lists using the `set()` and `intersection()` methods. However, what if we want to find the intersection based on a specific function applied to each element in both lists? In this challenge, you will create a function that takes in two lists and a function, and returns a list of elements that exist in both lists, after applying the provided function to each list element of both.
