# Number to Hex

## Introduction

In Python, we can easily convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent using the `hex()` function. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a function that takes a decimal number as an argument and returns its hexadecimal representation.

## Problem

Write a function `to_hex(dec)` that takes a decimal number as an argument and returns its hexadecimal representation. Your function should perform the following steps:

1. Use `hex()` to convert the decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent.
2. Return the hexadecimal representation.

## Example

```py
to_hex(41) # "0x29"
to_hex(332) # "0x14c"
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent using the `hex()` function in Python. You also wrote a function that performs this conversion.
