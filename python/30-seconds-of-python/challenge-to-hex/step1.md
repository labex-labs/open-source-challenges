# Number to Hex

## Problem
Write a function `to_hex(dec)` that takes a decimal number as an argument and returns its hexadecimal representation. Your function should perform the following steps:
1. Use `hex()` to convert the decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent.
2. Return the hexadecimal representation.

## Example
```py
to_hex(41) # "0x29"
to_hex(332) # "0x14c"
```
