# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to invert a dictionary with non-unique hashable values. You used a `collections.defaultdict` with `list` as the default value for each key, and then mapped the values of the dictionary to keys using `dict.append()`. Finally, you used `dict()` to convert the `collections.defaultdict` to a regular dictionary.
