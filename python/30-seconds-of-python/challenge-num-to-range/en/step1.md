# Map Number to Range

## Problem

Write a function called `num_to_range` that takes five arguments: `num`, `inMin`, `inMax`, `outMin`, and `outMax`. The function should return `num` mapped between `outMin`-`outMax` from `inMin`-`inMax`. In other words, the function should take a number (`num`) that falls within a certain range (`inMin`-`inMax`) and map it to a new range (`outMin`-`outMax`).

## Example

```python
num_to_range(5, 0, 10, 0, 100) # 50.0
```

In this example, we are mapping the number 5 from a range of 0 to 10 to a range of 0 to 100. The result should be 50.0.
