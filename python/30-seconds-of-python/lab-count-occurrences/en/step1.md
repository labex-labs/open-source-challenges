# Count Occurrences

Write a function `count_occurrences(lst, val)` that takes a list `lst` and a value `val` as arguments and returns the number of occurrences of `val` in `lst`. Your function should use the built-in `list.count()` method to count the number of occurrences.

```python
def count_occurrences(lst, val):
  return lst.count(val)
```

```python
count_occurrences([1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], 1) # 3
```
