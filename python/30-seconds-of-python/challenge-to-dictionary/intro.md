# Lists to Dictionary

In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Sometimes, we may have two separate lists, one containing the keys and the other containing the values, and we want to combine them into a dictionary. In this challenge, you will write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a dictionary where the elements of the first list serve as the keys and the elements of the second list serve as the values.
