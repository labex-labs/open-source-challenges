## Summary

In this challenge, you were tasked with writing a function that sorts a dictionary by key. You learned how to use the `sorted()` function to sort a list of tuple pairs from the dictionary and convert it back to a dictionary using the `dict()` function. You also learned how to use the `reverse` parameter in `sorted()` to sort the dictionary in reverse order.
