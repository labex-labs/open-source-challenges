# Introduction

Dictionaries are a fundamental data structure in Python that allow you to store key-value pairs. Sometimes, you may need to invert a dictionary, which means swapping the keys and values so that the values become the keys and the keys become the values. In this challenge, you will be tasked with writing a function that inverts a dictionary with non-unique hashable values.
