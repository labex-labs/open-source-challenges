# Combine Dictionary Values

Dictionaries are a fundamental data structure in Python, and they are used to store key-value pairs. Sometimes, we may need to combine the values of two or more dictionaries into a single dictionary. In this challenge, you will write a function that takes two or more dictionaries as arguments and returns a new dictionary that combines the values of the input dictionaries.
