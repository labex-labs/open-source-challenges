# Count Occurrences Challenge

## Introduction
In Python, it is often necessary to count the number of occurrences of a specific value in a list. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as analyzing data or processing user input. In this challenge, you will be tasked with writing a function that counts the number of occurrences of a given value in a list.

## Problem
Write a function `count_occurrences(lst, val)` that takes a list `lst` and a value `val` as arguments and returns the number of occurrences of `val` in `lst`. Your function should use the built-in `list.count()` method to count the number of occurrences.

## Example
```py
count_occurrences([1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], 1) # 3
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you learned how to count the number of occurrences of a value in a list using the `list.count()` method. This is a useful technique that can be applied in a variety of programming tasks.
