# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to calculate the weighted average of a list of numbers using Python. You used the `sum()` function to sum the products of the numbers by their weight and to sum the weights. You also used the `zip()` function and a list comprehension to iterate over the pairs of values and weights.
