# Mapped List Average

In Python, we can use the `map()` function to apply a function to each element of a list and return a new list with the modified elements. We can also use the `sum()` function to add up all the elements of a list. In this challenge, we will combine these two functions to calculate the average of a list, after mapping each element to a value using a provided function.
