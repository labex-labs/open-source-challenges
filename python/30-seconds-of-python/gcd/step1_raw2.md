# Greatest Common Divisor

## Introduction
In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

## Problem
Write a function called `gcd(numbers)` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns their greatest common divisor. Your function should use `functools.reduce()` and `math.gcd()` over the given list.

## Example
```py
gcd([8, 36, 28]) # 4
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you have learned how to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of numbers using `functools.reduce()` and `math.gcd()`.
