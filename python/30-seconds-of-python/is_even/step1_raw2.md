# Check if a Number is Even

## Introduction
In Python, we can easily check if a number is even or odd. In this challenge, you will be tasked with writing a function that checks whether a given number is even or not.

## Problem
Write a function `is_even(num)` that takes in a number as an argument and returns `True` if the number is even and `False` if the number is odd. To check whether a number is even or odd, you can use the modulo (`%`) operator. If a number is even, it will have no remainder when divided by 2. If a number is odd, it will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.

## Example
```py
is_even(4) # True
is_even(7) # False
is_even(0) # True
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you learned how to check if a number is even or odd in Python using the modulo operator. You can use this function to check whether a number is even or odd in your own programs.
