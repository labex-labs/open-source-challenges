## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to reverse a list or a string using slice notation in Python. You wrote a function called `reverse` that takes a list or a string as its input and returns a new list or string that contains the elements or characters in reverse order. Remember that slice notation can be used to extract a range of elements from a list or a string.
