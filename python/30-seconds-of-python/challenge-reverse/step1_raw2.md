# Challenge: Reverse List Function

## Introduction

In Python, lists and strings can be reversed using built-in functions. However, it is also possible to reverse a list or a string using slice notation.

In this challenge, you will write a function that reverses a list or a string using slice notation.

## Problem

Write a Python function called `reverse(itr)` that takes a list or a string as its argument and returns a new list or string that contains the elements or characters in reverse order.

Your function should have the following requirements:

- The function should be named `reverse`
- The function should take a single argument, which is a list or a string
- The function should return a new list or string that contains the elements or characters in reverse order
- The function should not modify the original list or string

## Example

```py
reverse([1, 2, 3]) # [3, 2, 1]
reverse('snippet') # 'teppins'
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to reverse a list or a string using slice notation in Python. You wrote a function called `reverse` that takes a list or a string as its input and returns a new list or string that contains the elements or characters in reverse order. Remember that slice notation can be used to extract a range of elements from a list or a string.
