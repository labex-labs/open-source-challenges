# Days Ago Challenge

## Problem

Your task is to write a function called `days_ago(n)` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the date of `n` days ago from today.

To solve this problem, you need to use the `date` class from the `datetime` module to get the current date and the `timedelta` class to subtract `n` days from the current date.

## Example

```py
days_ago(5) # date(2022, 11, 23)
```
