# Count Occurrences Challenge

## Problem
Write a function `count_occurrences(lst, val)` that takes a list `lst` and a value `val` as arguments and returns the number of occurrences of `val` in `lst`. Your function should use the built-in `list.count()` method to count the number of occurrences.

## Example
```py
count_occurrences([1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], 1) # 3
```
