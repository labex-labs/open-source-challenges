# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to decapitalize the first letter of a string in Python. You used list slicing and `str.lower()` to decapitalize the first letter of the string, and `str.join()` to combine the lowercase first letter with the rest of the characters. You also learned how to use an optional parameter to convert the rest of the string to uppercase.
