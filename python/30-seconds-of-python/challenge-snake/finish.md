## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to write a Python function that converts a string to snake case. You used `re.sub()` to match and replace words in the string, `str.lower()` to lowercase them, and `str.join()` to combine them using underscores as the separator. With this knowledge, you can now easily convert strings to snake case in your Python programs.
