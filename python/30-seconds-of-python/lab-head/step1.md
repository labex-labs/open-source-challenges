# List Head Function

## Problem

Write a Python function called `head(lst)` that takes a list as its argument and returns the first element of the list.

Your function should have the following requirements:

- The function should be named `head`
- The function should take a single argument, which is a list
- The function should return the first element of the list
- The function should not modify the original list

## Example

```py
head([1, 2, 3]) # 1
```
