# List Head Function

In Python, a list is an ordered collection of elements. Each element can be accessed by its index - a non-negative integer that represents the element's position in the list. The first element in the list has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.

In this challenge, you will write a function that returns the first element of a list, also known as the "head" of the list.
