# Factorial

## Problem
Write a function `factorial(num)` that takes a non-negative integer `num` as an argument and returns its factorial. The function should use recursion to calculate the factorial. If `num` is less than or equal to `1`, return `1`. Otherwise, return the product of `num` and the factorial of `num - 1`. The function should throw an exception if `num` is a negative or a floating-point number.

## Example
```py
factorial(6) # 720
```
