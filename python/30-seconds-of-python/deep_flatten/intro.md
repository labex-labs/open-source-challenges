# Deep Flatten List


In Python, a list can contain other lists as elements, and those lists can contain even more lists as elements, forming a nested structure. The process of flattening a nested list means to convert it into a one-dimensional list, where all the elements are at the same level. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a function that deep flattens a list, meaning that it will flatten all the nested lists recursively.
