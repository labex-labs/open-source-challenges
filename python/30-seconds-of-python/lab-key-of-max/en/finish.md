# Summary

In this lab, you built a Python function, `key_of_max`, to find the key associated with the largest value in a dictionary. You learned how to use the `max()` function with a custom `key` argument, and you handled the important edge case of an empty dictionary. You also wrote thorough unit tests using the `unittest` module, covering basic cases, empty dictionaries, and dictionaries with all negative values. This combination of functional code and comprehensive testing demonstrates good software development practices.
