# Handling the Empty Dictionary Case

Our current function has a problem: it will crash if the input dictionary `d` is empty. Let's fix that. Modify `key_of_max.py` to look like this:

```python
def key_of_max(d):
  """
  Returns the key associated with the maximum value in the dictionary 'd'.

  If multiple keys share the maximum value, any one of them may be returned.
  """
  if not d:  # Check if the dictionary is empty
      return None
  return max(d, key=d.get)
```

The added lines do the following:

- **`if not d:`**: In Python, an empty dictionary is considered "falsy." This `if` statement checks if the dictionary `d` is empty.
- **`return None`**: If the dictionary is empty, there's no maximum value, so we return `None`. This is a standard way to indicate the absence of a value in Python. This prevents the `max()` function from raising an error.

This is a crucial step in writing robust code: always consider edge cases!
