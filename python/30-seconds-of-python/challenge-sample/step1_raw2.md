# Random Element in List

## Introduction

In Python, you can easily get a random element from a list using the `random` module. This module provides a function called `choice()` which returns a random element from a given list. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a function that takes a list as an argument and returns a random element from that list.

## Problem

Write a function `random_element(lst)` that takes a list as an argument and returns a random element from that list.

- Use `random.choice()` to get a random element from `lst`.

## Example

```py
random_element([3, 7, 9, 11]) # 9
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to get a random element from a list in Python using the `random` module. You also wrote a function that takes a list as an argument and returns a random element from that list. This is a useful skill to have when working with lists in Python.
