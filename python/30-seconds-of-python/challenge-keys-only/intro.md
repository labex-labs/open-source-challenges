# Introduction

In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value. Sometimes, we may need to extract only the keys from a dictionary. In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a function that takes a flat dictionary as input and returns a list of all its keys.
