# List Intersection Challenge

## Problem

Write a function `list_intersection(a, b)` that takes two lists `a` and `b` as input and returns a new list containing only the elements that are present in both `a` and `b`. If there are no common elements, the function should return an empty list.

## Example

```python
list_intersection([1, 2, 3], [4, 3, 2]) # [2, 3]
list_intersection([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # []
list_intersection([1, 2, 3], [3, 3, 2]) # [2, 3]
```
