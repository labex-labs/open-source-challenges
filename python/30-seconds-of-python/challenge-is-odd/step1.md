# Check if a Number is Odd

## Problem

Write a function called `is_odd` that takes a single integer as an argument and returns `True` if the number is odd, and `False` if the number is even. Your function should perform the following steps:

1. Use the modulo (`%`) operator to check whether the number is even or odd.
2. If the number is odd, return `True`. If the number is even, return `False`.

## Example

Here is an example of how your function should behave:

```py
>>> is_odd(3)
True
>>> is_odd(4)
False
```
