# Check if a Number is Odd

## Introduction

In programming, it is often necessary to check whether a given number is odd or even. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as when working with loops, conditional statements, or mathematical operations. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a function that checks whether a given number is odd or even.

## Problem

Write a function called `is_odd` that takes a single integer as an argument and returns `True` if the number is odd, and `False` if the number is even. Your function should perform the following steps:

1. Use the modulo (`%`) operator to check whether the number is even or odd.
2. If the number is odd, return `True`. If the number is even, return `False`.

## Example

Here is an example of how your function should behave:

```py
>>> is_odd(3)
True
>>> is_odd(4)
False
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to write a function that checks whether a given number is odd or even. This can be useful in various programming scenarios, such as when working with loops, conditional statements, or mathematical operations. Remember to use the modulo operator to check whether a number is odd or even, and to return `True` if the number is odd, and `False` if the number is even.
