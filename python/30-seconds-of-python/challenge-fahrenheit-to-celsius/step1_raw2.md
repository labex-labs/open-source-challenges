# Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion

## Introduction
In many countries, temperature is measured in Celsius. However, in some countries, temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. It is important to be able to convert between these two units of measurement. In this challenge, you will write a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.

## Problem
Write a function `fahrenheit_to_celsius(degrees)` that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as a parameter and returns the temperature in Celsius. The function should follow the conversion formula `C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9`, where `C` is the temperature in Celsius and `F` is the temperature in Fahrenheit.

## Example
```py
fahrenheit_to_celsius(77) # 25.0
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you have written a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. This is an important skill to have when working with temperature data in different units of measurement.
