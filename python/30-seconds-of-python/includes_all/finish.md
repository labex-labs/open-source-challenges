## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to check if all the values in one list are included in another list. You used a `for` loop to iterate through each value in the `values` list and checked if it was included in the `lst` list using the `in` operator. If all the values were included, the function returned `True`. If any of the values were not included, the function returned `False`.
