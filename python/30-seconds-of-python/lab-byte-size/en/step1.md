# Byte Size of String

Write a function `byte_size(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns its byte size. The byte size of a string is the number of bytes required to store the string in memory. To calculate the byte size of a string, you need to encode the string using a specific encoding scheme. In this lab, you will use the UTF-8 encoding scheme.

To calculate the byte size of a string, you can follow these steps:

1. Encode the string using the UTF-8 encoding scheme.
2. Get the length of the encoded string.

Your function should return the length of the encoded string.

```python
def byte_size(s):
  return len(s.encode('utf-8'))
```

```python
byte_size('ðŸ˜€') # 4
byte_size('Hello World') # 11
```
