## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to write a function that checks whether a given number is odd or even. This can be useful in various programming scenarios, such as when working with loops, conditional statements, or mathematical operations. Remember to use the modulo operator to check whether a number is odd or even, and to return `True` if the number is odd, and `False` if the number is even.
