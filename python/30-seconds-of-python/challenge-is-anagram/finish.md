## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. You have used `str.isalnum()` to filter out non-alphanumeric characters, `str.lower()` to transform each character to lowercase, and `collections.Counter` to count the resulting characters for each string and compare the results.
