# Introduction

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. In Python, dictionaries are widely used to store and retrieve data efficiently. However, sometimes we need to invert a dictionary, i.e., swap the keys and values. This can be useful in many scenarios, such as searching for a key based on its value. In this challenge, you will write a Python function to invert a dictionary.
