# Days Ago Challenge

In Python, the `datetime` module provides classes for working with dates and times. One of the classes in this module is `date`, which represents a date (year, month, day) and provides various methods to work with dates. Another class is `timedelta`, which represents a duration or difference between two dates or times.
