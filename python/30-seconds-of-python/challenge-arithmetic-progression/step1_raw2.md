# Arithmetic Progression

## Introduction

An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a constant value to the previous term. For example, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. In this challenge, you will write a function that generates a list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with the given positive integer and up to the specified limit.

## Problem

Write a function `arithmetic_progression(n, lim)` that takes in two positive integers `n` and `lim` and returns a list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with `n` and up to `lim`. The function should use `range()` and `list()` with the appropriate start, step, and end values to generate the list.

### Input

- Two positive integers `n` and `lim` where `n` is the starting number and `lim` is the limit.

### Output

- A list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with `n` and up to `lim`.

### Example

```py
arithmetic_progression(5, 25) # [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you wrote a function that generates a list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with the given positive integer and up to the specified limit. You used `range()` and `list()` with the appropriate start, step, and end values to generate the list.
