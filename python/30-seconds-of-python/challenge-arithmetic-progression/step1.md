# Arithmetic Progression

## Problem

Write a function `arithmetic_progression(n, lim)` that takes in two positive integers `n` and `lim` and returns a list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with `n` and up to `lim`. The function should use `range()` and `list()` with the appropriate start, step, and end values to generate the list.

### Input

- Two positive integers `n` and `lim` where `n` is the starting number and `lim` is the limit.

### Output

- A list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with `n` and up to `lim`.

### Example

```py
arithmetic_progression(5, 25) # [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
```
