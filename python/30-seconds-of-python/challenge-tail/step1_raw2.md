# List Tail Challenge

## Introduction

In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Sometimes, we need to get all the elements of a list except for the first one. This can be done using the list tail method. In this challenge, you will be asked to implement a function that returns all elements in a list except for the first one.

## Problem

Write a function `tail(lst)` that takes a list as an argument and returns all elements in the list except for the first one. If the list contains only one element, return the whole list.

## Example

```py
tail([1, 2, 3]) # [2, 3]
tail([1]) # [1]
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to implement a function that returns all elements in a list except for the first one. You have also learned how to handle the case where the list contains only one element. Keep practicing to improve your Python skills!
