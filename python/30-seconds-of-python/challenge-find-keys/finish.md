## Summary


In this challenge, you have learned how to find all the keys in a dictionary that have a given value. You have written a Python function called `find_keys(dictionary, value)` that takes in a dictionary and a value as arguments and returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary that have the given value. You have used the `dictionary.items()` method and a list comprehension to solve this problem.
