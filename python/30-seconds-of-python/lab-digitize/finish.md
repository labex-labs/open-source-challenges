## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to convert a number into a list of its digits using Python. By using the `map()` function and the `int` function, you can easily convert each character in a string to an integer and return a list of those integers. This technique can be useful for various applications, such as performing mathematical operations on individual digits or manipulating numbers in a more granular way.
