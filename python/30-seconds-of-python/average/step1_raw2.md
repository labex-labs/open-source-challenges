# Average Challenge

## Introduction
In Python, calculating the average of a set of numbers is a common task. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a function that takes in two or more numbers and returns their average.

## Problem
Write a function called `average` that takes in two or more numbers and returns their average. Your function should follow these guidelines:

- Use `sum()` to sum all of the `args` provided, divide by `len()`.
- The function should be able to handle any number of arguments.
- The function should return a float.

## Example
```py
average(*[1, 2, 3]) # 2.0
average(1, 2, 3) # 2.0
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you have written a function that calculates the average of two or more numbers. You have used the `sum()` function to add up all of the numbers and then divided by the number of arguments using `len()`. This is a useful function to have in your Python toolbox for future projects.
