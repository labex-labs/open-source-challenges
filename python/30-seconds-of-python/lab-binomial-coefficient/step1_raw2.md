# Binomial Coefficient

## Introduction

The binomial coefficient is a mathematical concept that calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n` items without repetition and without order. It is often used in probability theory and combinatorics.

## Problem

Write a function called `binomial_coefficient(n, k)` that takes in two integers `n` and `k` and returns the binomial coefficient of `n` and `k`. Your function should use the `math.comb()` method to calculate the binomial coefficient.

## Example

```py
binomial_coefficient(8, 2) # 28
binomial_coefficient(5, 3) # 10
binomial_coefficient(10, 5) # 252
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to calculate the binomial coefficient using the `math.comb()` method. This concept is useful in probability theory and combinatorics, and can be used to calculate the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n` items without repetition and without order.
