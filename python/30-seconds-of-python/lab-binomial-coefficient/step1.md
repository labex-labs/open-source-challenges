# Binomial Coefficient

## Problem

Write a function called `binomial_coefficient(n, k)` that takes in two integers `n` and `k` and returns the binomial coefficient of `n` and `k`. Your function should use the `math.comb()` method to calculate the binomial coefficient.

## Example

```py
binomial_coefficient(8, 2) # 28
binomial_coefficient(5, 3) # 10
binomial_coefficient(10, 5) # 252
```
