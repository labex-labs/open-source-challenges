# RGB to Hex Conversion Challenge

## Introduction
In web development, colors are often represented in hexadecimal format. However, sometimes we need to convert RGB values to hexadecimal format. In this challenge, you will be tasked with writing a function that converts RGB values to a hexadecimal color code.

## Problem
Write a function `rgb_to_hex(r, g, b)` that takes in three integers representing the values of the red, green, and blue components of a color, and returns a string representing the hexadecimal color code. The output string should be in the format `RRGGBB`, where `RR`, `GG`, and `BB` are two-digit hexadecimal values representing the red, green, and blue components respectively.

For example, if the input values are `255`, `165`, and `1`, the output should be the string `'FFA501'`.

## Example
```py
rgb_to_hex(255, 165, 1) # 'FFA501'
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you have learned how to convert RGB values to hexadecimal format. By completing this challenge, you have gained a better understanding of color representation in web development.
