# Number is divisible

## Introduction

In Python, we can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is divisible by another number. If the remainder is equal to `0`, then the number is divisible. In this challenge, you will create a function that checks if a number is divisible by another number.

## Problem

Write a function `is_divisible(dividend, divisor)` that takes two integers as arguments and returns `True` if the `dividend` is divisible by the `divisor`, and `False` otherwise.

## Example

```py
is_divisible(6, 3) # True
is_divisible(7, 2) # False
is_divisible(10, 5) # True
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to check if a number is divisible by another number using the modulo operator. You created a function that takes two integers as arguments and returns `True` if the `dividend` is divisible by the `divisor`, and `False` otherwise.
