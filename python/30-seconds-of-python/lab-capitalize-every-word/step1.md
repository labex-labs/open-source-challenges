# Capitalize Every Word

Write a function `capitalize_every_word(s)` that takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a new string with the first letter of every word capitalized.

```python
def capitalize_every_word(s):
  return s.title()
```

```python
capitalize_every_word('hello world!') # 'Hello World!'
```
