# Every nth element in list

## Problem

Write a function `every_nth(lst, nth)` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `nth` as arguments and returns a new list containing every `nth` element of the original list.

## Example

```python
every_nth([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) # [ 2, 4, 6 ]
```

## Constraints

- The input list `lst` will contain at least `nth` elements.
- The value of `nth` will be greater than 0.
