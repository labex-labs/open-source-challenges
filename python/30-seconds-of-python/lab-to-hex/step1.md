# Number to Hex

Write a function `to_hex(dec)` that takes a decimal number as an argument and returns its hexadecimal representation. Your function should perform the following steps:

1. Use `hex()` to convert the decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent.
2. Return the hexadecimal representation.

```py
def to_hex(dec):
  return hex(dec)
```

```py
to_hex(41) # 0x29
to_hex(332) # 0x14c
```
