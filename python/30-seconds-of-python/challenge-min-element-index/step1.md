# Index of min element

## Problem

Write a function `min_element_index(arr)` that takes a list of integers `arr` as an argument and returns the index of the element with the minimum value in the list.

To solve this problem, you can use the `min()` function to obtain the minimum value in the list and then use the `list.index()` method to return its index.

## Example

```python
min_element_index([3, 5, 2, 6, 10, 7, 9]) # 2
```

In this example, the minimum value in the list `[3, 5, 2, 6, 10, 7, 9]` is `2`, which is located at index `2`.
