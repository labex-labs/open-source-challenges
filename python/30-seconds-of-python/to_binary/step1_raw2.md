# Number to Binary

## Introduction
In computer science, binary is a base-2 numbering system that represents numeric values using two symbols, typically 0 and 1. Binary is widely used in computing and digital electronics. In this challenge, you will write a Python function that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation.

## Problem
Write a function `to_binary(n)` that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string. Your function should perform the following steps:
1. Use `bin()` to convert the decimal number into its binary equivalent.
2. Return the binary representation as a string.

## Example
```py
to_binary(100) # '0b1100100'
to_binary(42) # '0b101010'
to_binary(255) # '0b11111111'
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you learned how to convert a decimal number into its binary representation using Python. You can use this function to perform binary operations or to display binary values in your programs.
