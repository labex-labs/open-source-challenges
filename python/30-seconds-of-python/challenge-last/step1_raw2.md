# Last List Element

## Introduction
In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Sometimes, we need to access the last element of a list. In this challenge, you will write a function that returns the last element of a list.

## Problem
Write a function called `last(lst)` that takes a list as an argument and returns the last element of the list. 

## Example
```py
last([1, 2, 3]) # 3
last(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']) # 'cherry'
last([]) # None
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you learned how to write a function that returns the last element of a list. You can use the index `-1` to access the last element of a list.
