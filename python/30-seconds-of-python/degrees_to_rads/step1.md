# Degrees to Radians Challenge

## Problem
Write a function `degrees_to_rads(deg)` that takes an angle in degrees as an argument and returns the angle in radians. Your function should use the following formula to convert degrees to radians:

```
radians = (degrees * pi) / 180.0
```

where `pi` is a constant value representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (approximately 3.14159).

Your function should return the angle in radians rounded to 4 decimal places.

## Example
```py
degrees_to_rads(180) # returns 3.1416
degrees_to_rads(90) # returns 1.5708
degrees_to_rads(45) # returns 0.7854
```
