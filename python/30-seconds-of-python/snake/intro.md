# Snakecase String

In Python, snake case is a naming convention where words are separated by underscores. This is commonly used for naming variables, functions, and other identifiers. However, sometimes we may have strings that are not in snake case and we need to convert them. In this challenge, you will be tasked with writing a Python function that converts a string to snake case.
