# Introduction

In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Sometimes, we need to transform the values of a dictionary using a function. This challenge will test your ability to create a function that takes a dictionary and a function as arguments and returns a new dictionary with the same keys as the original dictionary and values generated by running the provided function for each value.
