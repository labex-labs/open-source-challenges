# Find All Matching Indexes

In Python, we can use the `enumerate()` function to iterate over a list and get both the index and the value of each element. We can also use list comprehension to filter elements that satisfy a certain condition. In this challenge, you will use these concepts to create a function that finds the indexes of all elements in a list that satisfy a given testing function.
