## Summary

In this challenge, you were tasked with creating a function that sorts a list based on another list containing the desired indexes. By using the `zip()` and `sorted()` functions, you were able to combine and sort the two lists based on the values of `indexes`. You then used a list comprehension to get the first element of each pair from the result and returned the sorted list.
