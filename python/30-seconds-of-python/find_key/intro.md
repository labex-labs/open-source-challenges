# Find the Key of a Value in a Dictionary

Dictionaries are a powerful data structure in Python that allow you to store key-value pairs. Sometimes, you may need to find the key associated with a particular value in a dictionary. In this challenge, you will write a function that takes a dictionary and a value as input, and returns the first key in the dictionary that has the given value.
