# Miles to km

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will write a Python function to convert miles to kilometers. You will be given a distance in miles and you need to return the equivalent distance in kilometers.

## Problem

Write a Python function called `miles_to_km` that takes a parameter `miles` (a float or an integer) and returns the equivalent distance in kilometers. You should use the following conversion formula: `km = mi * 1.609344`.

## Example

```py
miles_to_km(5.03) # 8.09500032
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to convert miles to kilometers using a Python function. You should now be able to take any distance in miles and convert it to kilometers using the formula `km = mi * 1.609344`.
