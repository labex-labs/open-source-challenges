# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because when you reverse the word, it still spells "racecar". In this challenge, you will write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
