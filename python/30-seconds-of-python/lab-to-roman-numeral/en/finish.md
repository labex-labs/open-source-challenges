# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to convert an integer to its Roman numeral representation. You used a lookup list containing tuples in the form of (roman value, integer) and a `for` loop to iterate over the values in the lookup list. You also used `divmod()` to update `num` with the remainder, adding the Roman numeral representation to the result.
