# Introduction

In Python, we can use the `map()` function to apply a function to each element of a list and return a new list with the modified values. We can also use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of a list. In this challenge, you will need to write a function that takes a list and a function as arguments, maps each element of the list to a value using the provided function, and returns the sum of the values.
