## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to create a function that initializes a list containing the numbers in the specified range where the ratio between two terms is `step`. You have used `range()`, `math.log()`, and `math.floor()` and a list comprehension to create a list of the appropriate length, applying the step for each element.
