# Km to Miles

Write a Python function called `km_to_miles` that takes a parameter `km` (a float) and returns the equivalent distance in miles (also a float). The conversion formula is `mi = km * 0.621371`.

```python
def km_to_miles(km):
  return km * 0.621371
```

```python
km_to_miles(8.1) # 5.0331051
```
