# Km to Miles Challenge

## Introduction
In this challenge, you will be required to write a Python function that converts kilometers to miles. You will be given a distance in kilometers and you will need to return the equivalent distance in miles.

## Problem
Write a Python function called `km_to_miles` that takes a parameter `km` (a float) and returns the equivalent distance in miles (also a float). The conversion formula is `mi = km * 0.621371`.

## Example
```py
km_to_miles(8.1) # 5.0331051
```

## Summary
In this challenge, you have learned how to convert kilometers to miles using a simple formula. You have also written a Python function that implements this formula and returns the equivalent distance in miles.
