# Split List into N Chunks


In Python, we can split a list into smaller lists of equal size using a simple function. This can be useful when we want to process large amounts of data in smaller chunks. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` smaller lists, each containing an equal number of elements from the original list.
