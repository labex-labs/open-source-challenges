# Spread List

In Python, a list can contain other lists as elements. Sometimes, we need to flatten a list, which means to convert a nested list into a single list that contains all the elements of the original list. One way to do this is by using the spread operator. In this challenge, you will be asked to implement a function that flattens a list using the spread operator.
