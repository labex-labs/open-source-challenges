# Number to Binary

## Problem

Write a function `to_binary(n)` that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string. Your function should perform the following steps:

1. Use `bin()` to convert the decimal number into its binary equivalent.
2. Return the binary representation as a string.

## Example

```py
to_binary(100) # '0b1100100'
to_binary(42) # '0b101010'
to_binary(255) # '0b11111111'
```
