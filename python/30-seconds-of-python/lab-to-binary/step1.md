# Number to Binary

Write a function `to_binary(n)` that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string. Your function should perform the following steps:

1. Use `bin()` to convert the decimal number into its binary equivalent.
2. Return the binary representation as a string.

```python
def to_binary(n):
  return bin(n)
```

```python
to_binary(100) # 0b1100100
```
