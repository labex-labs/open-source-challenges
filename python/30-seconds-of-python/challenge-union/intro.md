# List Union Challenge

In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Sometimes, we need to combine two lists and remove any duplicates to get a new list containing all the unique elements. This process is called list union. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a Python function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all the unique elements from both lists.
