# List Union Challenge

## Introduction

In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. Sometimes, we need to combine two lists and remove any duplicates to get a new list containing all the unique elements. This process is called list union. In this challenge, you will be asked to write a Python function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all the unique elements from both lists.

## Problem

Write a Python function called `list_union(a, b)` that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all the unique elements from both lists. Your function should perform the following steps:

1. Combine the two input lists `a` and `b` into a single list.
2. Remove any duplicates from the combined list.
3. Return the new list containing all the unique elements.

Your function should not modify the input lists `a` and `b`.

## Example

```py
list_union([1, 2, 3], [4, 3, 2]) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
list_union(['apple', 'banana', 'orange'], ['pear', 'banana', 'kiwi']) # ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'pear', 'kiwi']
```

## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to write a Python function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing all the unique elements from both lists. You have also learned how to combine two lists, remove duplicates, and return a new list.
