# Introduction

Function composition is a technique used in functional programming to combine two or more functions to create a new function. In Python, we can use the `compose` function from the `functools` module to perform function composition. However, the `compose` function performs right-to-left function composition, which may not be suitable for all use cases. In this challenge, you will implement a function that performs left-to-right function composition.
