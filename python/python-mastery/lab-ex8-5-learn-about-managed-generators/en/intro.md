# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Learn about managed generators

**Files Created:** `multitask.py`, `server.py`

A generator or coroutine function can never execute without being driven by some other code. For example, a generator used for iteration doesn't do anything unless iteration is actually carried out using a for-loop. Similarly, a collection of coroutines won't run unless their `send()` method is invoked somehow.

In advanced applications of generators, it is possible to drive generators in various unusual ways. In this exercise, we look at a few examples.
