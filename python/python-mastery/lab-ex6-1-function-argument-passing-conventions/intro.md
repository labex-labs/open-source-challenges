# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Learn more about function argument passing conventions

**Files Created:** `structure.py`, `stock.py`

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

This exercise is going to start a long road of rewriting the `stock.py` file in a more
sane way. Before doing anything, copy your work in `stock.py` to a new file
`orig_stock.py`.
