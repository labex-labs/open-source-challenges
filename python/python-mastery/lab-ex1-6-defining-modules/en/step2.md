# Main Module

In your `pcost.py` program, the last statement called a function and printed out the result. Modify the program so that this step only occurs if the program is run as the main program. Now, try running the program two ways:

First, run the program as main:

```bash
python3 pcost.py
44671.15
```

Next, run the program as a library import. You should not see any output.

```python
>>> import pcost
>>>
```
