# Reading Objects

Change the `read_portfolio()` function to use the new `Stock.from_row()` method that you wrote.

Point of thought: Which version of code do you like better? The version of `read_portfolio()` that performed the type conversions or the one that performs conversions in the `Stock.from_row()` method? Think about data abstraction.

Can you modify `read_portfolio()` to create objects using a class other than `Stock`? For example, can the user select the class that they want?
