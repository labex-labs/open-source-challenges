# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Type checking and interfaces
- Abstract base classes

**Files Modified:** `tableformat.py`

In Exercise 3.5, we modified the `tableformat.py` file to have a `TableFormatter` class and to use various subclasses for different output formats. In this exercise, we extend that code a bit more.
