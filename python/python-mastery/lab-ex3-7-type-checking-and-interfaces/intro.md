# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Type checking and interfaces
- Abstract base classes

**Files Modified:** `tableformat.py`

In [Exercise 3.5](ex3_5.md), we modified the `tableformat.py` file to have a `TableFormatter`
class and to use various subclasses for different output formats. In this exercise, we extend that
code a bit more.
