# Stuck on the bus

The file `ctabus.csv` is a CSV file containing daily ridership data for the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus system from January 1, 2001 to August 31, 2013. It contains approximately 577000 rows of data. Use Python to view a few lines of data to see what it looks like:

```python
>>> f = open('/home/labex/project/ctabus.csv')
>>> next(f)
'route,date,daytype,rides\n'
>>> next(f)
'3,01/01/2001,U,7354\n'
>>> next(f)
'4,01/01/2001,U,9288\n'
>>>
```

There are 4 columns of data.

- route: Column 0. The bus route name.
- date: Column 1. A date string of the form MM/DD/YYYY.
- daytype: Column 2. A day type code (U=Sunday/Holiday, A=Saturday, W=Weekday)
- rides: Column 3. Total number of riders (integer)

The `rides` column records the total number of people who boarded a bus on that route on a given day. Thus, from the example, 7354 people rode the number 3 bus on January 1, 2001.
