# Introduction

**Objectives:**

- Figure out the most memory-efficient way to store a lot of data.
- Learn about different ways of representing records including tuples,
  dictionaries, classes, and named tuples.

In this exercise, we look at different choices for representing data
structures with an eye towards memory use and efficiency. A lot of
people use Python to perform various kinds of data analysis so knowing
about different options and their tradeoffs is useful information.
