**Objectives:**

- Make a new primitive type

In most programs, you use the primitive types such as `int`, `float`, and `str` to represent data. However, you're not limited to just those types. The standard library has modules such as the `decimal` and `fractions` module that implement new primitive types. You can also make your own types as long as you understand the underlying protocols which make Python objects work. In this exercise, we'll make a new primitive type. There are a lot of little details to worry about, but this will give you a general sense for what's required.
