# Defining a function

Take the program `pcost.py` that you wrote in the last lab and
convert it into a function `portfolio_cost(filename)` that takes a
filename as input, reads the portfolio data in that file, and returns
the total cost of the portfolio as a floating point number. Once you
written the function, have your program call the function by simply
adding this statement at the end:

```python
print(portfolio_cost('/home/labex/project/portfolio.dat'))
```

Run your program and make sure it produces the same output as
before.
