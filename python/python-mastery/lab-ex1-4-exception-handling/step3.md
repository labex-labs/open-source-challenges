# Interactive Experimentation

Run your `pcost.py` program and call the
`portfolio_cost()` function directly from the interactive
interpreter.

```python
>>> portfolio_cost('/home/labex/project/portfolio.dat')
44671.15
>>> portfolio_cost('/home/labex/project/portfolio2.dat')
19908.75
>>>
```

Note: To do this, you might have to run python using the `-i`
option. For example:

```bash
python3 -i pcost.py
```

We are going to be writing a lot of programs where you define
functions and experiment interactively. Make sure you know how to do
this.
