# Launch Python

Start Python3 on your machine. Make sure you can type simple
statements such as the "hello world" program:

```python
>>> print('Hello World')
Hello World
>>>
```

In much of this course, you'll want to make sure you can work from
the interactive REPL like this. If you're working from a different
environment such as IPython or Jupyter Notebooks, that's fine.
