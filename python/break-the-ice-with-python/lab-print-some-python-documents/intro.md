# Print some Python Documents

Python has a lot of built-in functions, and it can be overwhelming to learn how to use them all. However, Python has a built-in document function for every built-in function, making it easier to understand how to use them. In this lab, you will write a program to print out the documents for some of Python's built-in functions, such as `str()`, `sorted()`, and `input()`, as well as adding a document for your own function.
