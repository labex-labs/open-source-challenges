# Counting Characters in Strings

Please write a program which count and print the numbers of each character in a string input by console.

## Example

If the following string is given as input to the program:

```bash
abcdefgabc
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
a,2
c,2
b,2
e,1
d,1
g,1
f,1
```

## Hints

- Use the `count()` method to get the number of each character.
