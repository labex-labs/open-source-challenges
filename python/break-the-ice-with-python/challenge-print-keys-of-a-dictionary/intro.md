# Print Keys of a Dictionary

In Python, dictionaries are a useful data structure for storing key-value pairs. In this programming challenge, we will define a function that generates a dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to 20 (inclusive) and values that are the square of the keys. The function will then print only the keys of the dictionary.
