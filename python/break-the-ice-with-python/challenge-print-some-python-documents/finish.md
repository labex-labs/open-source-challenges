# Summary

In this challenge, you learned about Python's built-in document function for every built-in function. You wrote a program to print out the documents for some of Python's built-in functions, such as `str()`, `sorted()`, and `input()`, and added a document for your own function. By using the `__doc__` method, you were able to easily access and print out the documentation for each function.
