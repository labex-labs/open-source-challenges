# Print some Python Documents

Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.

Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as `str()`, `sorted()`, `input()`.

And add document for your own function.

## Example

When you output the document for `str()`, the output of the program should be:

```bash
str(object='') -> str
str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str

Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
or repr(object).
encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().
errors defaults to 'strict'.
```

## Hints

- The built-in document method is `__doc__`
