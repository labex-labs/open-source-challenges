# Summary

In this lab, we learned about inheritance in object-oriented programming. We defined a class named `Shape` and its subclass `Square`. We also discussed how to override a method in the superclass. By using inheritance, we can create new classes that are based on existing classes, which can save us a lot of time and effort in programming.
