# Summary

The task is to find the second highest score from the given list of scores for a University Sports Day. We can solve this problem by sorting the list of scores in descending order and then returning the second element of the list. The `sorted()` method can be used to sort the list. The input is taken as a string and then converted into a list of integers. Finally, the runner-up score is printed as output.
