# Print each Even Numbers

Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 2200 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

## Example

The output of the program should be:

```bash
2000,2002,2004,2006,2008,2020,2022,2024,2026,2028,2040,2042,2044,2046,2048,2060,2062,2064,2066,2068,2080,2082,2084,2086,2088,2200
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
