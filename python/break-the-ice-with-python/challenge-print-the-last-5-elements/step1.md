# Print the Last 5 Elements

Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the last 5 elements in the list.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
range(1, 21)
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[256, 289, 324, 361, 400]
```

## Hints

- Use `**` operator to get power of a number.
- Use `range()` for loops.
- Use `list.append()` to add values into a list.
- Use `[n1:n2]` to slice a list
