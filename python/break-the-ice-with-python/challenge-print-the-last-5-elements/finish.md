# Summary

The program uses the `range()` function to generate a list of numbers between 1 and 20, then squares each number using the `**` operator and appends the result to a new list. Finally, the program prints the last 5 elements of the list using slicing. The hints provided suggest the use of `range()`, `list.append()`, and slicing to complete the challenge.
