# Summary

In summary, binary search is a powerful algorithm that can be used to search for an item in a sorted list. By dividing the list in half and eliminating the half that does not contain the item, binary search can quickly find the desired element. The function we have discussed in this challenge returns the index of the element to be searched in the list. By using the hints provided, you can easily implement this function in your own code.
