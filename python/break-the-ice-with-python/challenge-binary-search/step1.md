# Binary Search

Please write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The function should return the index of element to be searched in the list.

## Example

If you are given the following sorted list:

```bash
[1,3,5,7,9]
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
4
```

## Hints

- Use `if/elif` to deal with conditions.
