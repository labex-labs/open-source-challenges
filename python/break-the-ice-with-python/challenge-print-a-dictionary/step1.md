# Print a Dictionary

Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
range(1,21)
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225, 16: 256, 17: 289, 18:
324, 19: 361, 20: 400}
```

## Hints

- Use `dict[key]=value` pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
- Use `**` operator to get power of a number.
- Use `range()` for loops.
