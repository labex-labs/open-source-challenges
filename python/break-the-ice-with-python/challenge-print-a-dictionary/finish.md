# Summary

The task requires the creation of a Python function that generates a dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to 20 (inclusive) and values that are the squares of the keys. The function makes use of the `dict[key]=value` pattern to insert entries into the dictionary and the `**` operator to calculate the squares. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the keys. The output of the function is a dictionary that is printed to the console.
