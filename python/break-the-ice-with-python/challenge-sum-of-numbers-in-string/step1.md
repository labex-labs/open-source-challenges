# Sum of Numbers in String

Define a function that can receive two integer numbers in string form and compute their sum and then print it in console.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
3
4
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
7
```

## Hints

- Use `int()` to convert a string to integer.
