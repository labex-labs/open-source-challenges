# Summary

This task requires us to write a program that computes and prints the Fibonacci Sequence up to a given input n. The program should take the input from the console and output the sequence as a list of numbers separated by commas. We can use a recursive function in Python to generate the sequence and list comprehension to generate a list from an existing list. Finally, we can use string.join() to join the list of strings.
