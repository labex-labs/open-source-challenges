# Summary

The program uses the `^` operator to perform the symmetric difference operation and the `sorted()` method to sort the resulting list in ascending order. The input consists of two sets of integers, M and N, where M and N are the sizes of the sets respectively. The program then outputs the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, one per line.
