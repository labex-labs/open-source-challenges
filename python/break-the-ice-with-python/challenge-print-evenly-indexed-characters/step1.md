# Print Evenly Indexed Characters

Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the characters that have even indexes.

## Example

If the following string is given as input to the program:

```bash
H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
Helloworld
```

## Hints

- Use index to iterate through a string and determine if the index is even.
