# Summary

To solve this challenge, we can use list comprehension to create a new list that only includes elements from the original list that are not divisible by 5 and 7. The resulting list should only contain the numbers [12, 24, 88, 120, 155]. Using list comprehension allows us to efficiently remove multiple elements from the list in one line of code.
