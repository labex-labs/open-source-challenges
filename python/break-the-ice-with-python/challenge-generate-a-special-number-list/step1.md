# Generate a Special Number List

Please write a program to randomly generate a list with 5 numbers, which are divisible by 5 and 7 , between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
range(1,1001)
```

Then, the output of the program may be:

```bash
[700, 875, 525, 490, 245]
```

## Hints

- Use `range()` to generate an iterable object.
- Use `random.sample()` to generate a list of random values.
