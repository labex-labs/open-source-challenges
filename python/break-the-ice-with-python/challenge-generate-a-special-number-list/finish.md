# Summary

To generate the list of special numbers, you can use the `range()` function to create an iterable object with all the numbers within the range of 1 to 1000. Then, you can use the `random.sample()` function to randomly select 5 numbers from the iterable object. However, you need to ensure that the selected numbers are divisible by both 5 and 7.
