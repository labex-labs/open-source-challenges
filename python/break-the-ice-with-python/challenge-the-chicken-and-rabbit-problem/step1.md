# The Chicken and Rabbit Problem

Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

## Example

If We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm.

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
