# Compute the Distance

This program is designed to compute the distance traveled by a robot in a plane, starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move in four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT`, with a given number of steps. The program will output the distance from the current position to the original point, rounded to the nearest integer.
