# Print a Tuple

In this lab, we are required to define a function that generates and prints a tuple containing the square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). The function will use the `**` operator to get the power of a number, `range()` for loops, `list.append()` to add values into a list, and `tuple()` to get a tuple from a list.
