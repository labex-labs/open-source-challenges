# Summary

To summarize, we have learned how to generate and print a tuple containing the square of numbers between 1 and 20 using Python. We have used various built-in functions such as range(), list.append(), and tuple() to achieve this lab. This exercise has helped us to understand the basics of tuples and how they can be used in Python programming.
