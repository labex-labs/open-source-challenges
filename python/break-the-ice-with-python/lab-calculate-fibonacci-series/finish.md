# Summary

To calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence, we can use the formula f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2), where f(0)=0 and f(1)=1. We can write a recursive function in Python to implement this formula. The program should take the value of n as input from the console and output the corresponding value of f(n).
