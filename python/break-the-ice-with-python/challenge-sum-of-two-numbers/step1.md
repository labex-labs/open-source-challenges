# Sum of Two Numbers

Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.

## Example

Suppose the following parameters are passed to the program:

```bash
1, 2
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
3
```

## Hints

- Define a function with two numbers as arguments. You can compute the sum in the function and return the value.
