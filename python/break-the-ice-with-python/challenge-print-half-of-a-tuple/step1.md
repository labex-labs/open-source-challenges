# Print Half of a Tuple

With a given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
```

## Hints

- Use `[n1:n2]` notation to get a slice from a tuple.
