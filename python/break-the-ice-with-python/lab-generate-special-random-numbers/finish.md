# Summary

To generate a random number that is divisible by both 5 and 7 between 10 and 150, we can use the range() function to generate an iterable object and the random.sample() function to generate a list of random values. We can then use list comprehension to filter out the values that are not divisible by both 5 and 7 and select a random value from the remaining list. With these simple steps, we can easily generate a special random number that satisfies the given conditions.
