# Assert Expression

Please write assert statements to verify that every number in the list [2,4,5,6] is even.

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
[2,4,5,6]
```

The output of the program should be:

```bash
AssertionError: 5 is not an even number
```

## Hints

- Use `assert` expression to make assertion.
