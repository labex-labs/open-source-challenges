# Define a Class with Generators

Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
7
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
0
7
```

## Hints

- Consider using class, function and comprehension.
