# Print Words in Order

Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
without,hello,bag,world
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
bag,hello,without,world
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
