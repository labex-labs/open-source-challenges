# Summary

To define a subclass in Python, we use the `class Subclass(ParentClass)` syntax. In this challenge, we define a class named `American` and its subclass `NewYorker`. The `NewYorker` class is defined as a subclass of the `American` class using the `pass` keyword. This allows the `NewYorker` class to inherit all the attributes and methods of the `American` class.
