# Generates a 2 Dimensional Array

Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.

## Note

i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1.., Y-1.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
3,5
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.
