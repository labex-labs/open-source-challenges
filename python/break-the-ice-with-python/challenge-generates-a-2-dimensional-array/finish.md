# Summary

To generate the 2-dimensional array, the program takes in two digits, X and Y, as input. It then calculates the element values in the array using the formula i \_ j, where i and j are the row and column indices. The output is displayed as a comma-separated list of arrays, with each array representing a row in the 2-dimensional array. The program assumes that the input is provided in a comma-separated form via the console.
