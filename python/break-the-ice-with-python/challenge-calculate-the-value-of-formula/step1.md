# Calculate the Value of Formula

Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

Q = Square root of [(2 _ C _ D)/H]

Following are the fixed values of C and H:

C is 50. H is 30.

D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
100,150,180
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
18,22,24
```

## Hints

- If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26).
- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
