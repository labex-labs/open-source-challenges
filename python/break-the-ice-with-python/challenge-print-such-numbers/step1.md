# Print such Numbers

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 2200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

## Example

The output of the program should be:

```bash
2002,2009,2016,2023,2037,2044,2051,2058,2072,2079,2086,2093,2107,2114,2121,2128,2142,2149,2156,2163,2177,2184,2191,2198,
```

## Hints

- Consider using `range(#begin, #end)` method.
