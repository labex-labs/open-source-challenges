# Summary

The program uses the `range()` method to iterate through all the numbers between 2000 and 2200 (both included). It then checks if each number is divisible by 7 and not a multiple of 5. If the number satisfies both conditions, it is added to a list. Finally, the program prints the list as a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
