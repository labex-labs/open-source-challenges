# Permutation of Lists

Please write a program which prints all permutations of [1,2,3].

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
[1, 2, 3]
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 3, 2)
(2, 1, 3)
(2, 3, 1)
(3, 1, 2)
(3, 2, 1)
```

## Hints

- Use `permutations()` function to get permutations of list.
