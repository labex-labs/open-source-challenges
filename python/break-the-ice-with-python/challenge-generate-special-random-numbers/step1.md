# Generate Special Random Numbers

Please write a program to output a random number, which is divisible by 5 and 7, between 10 and 150 inclusive using random module and list comprehension.

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
range(10,151)
```

Then, the output of the program may be:

```bash
105
```

## Hints

- Use `range()` to generate an iterable object.
- Use `random.sample()` to generate a list of random values.
