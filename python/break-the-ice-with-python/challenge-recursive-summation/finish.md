# Summary

The task is to write a recursive function that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N. The input is a single integer N, and the output should be the sum of all numbers from 1 to N. The solution involves creating a recursive function that adds the current number to the sum of the previous numbers until N is reached. The function should return the final sum.
