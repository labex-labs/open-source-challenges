# Get a Tuple of Even Elements

Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple `(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```

## Hints

- Use `for` to iterate the tuple.
- Use `tuple()` to generate a tuple from a list.
