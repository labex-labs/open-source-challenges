# Summation of Series

Write a program to compute 1/2+2/3+3/4+...+n/n+1 with a given n input by console (n>0).

## Example

If the following n is given as input to the program:

```bash
5
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
3.55
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- Use `float()` to convert an integer to a float.Even if not converted it wont cause a problem because python by default understands the data type of a value
