# Catching the Exceptions

File path is `/home/labex/project/catch_the_exceptions.py`

Open the `catch_the_exceptions.py` file and write a `division` function to throw a `ZeroDivisionError` exception in the function. 
Catch it with a `try-except` statement.

## Hints

Dividing a non-zero number by zero throws a `ZeroDivisionError` exception, which is then caught with a `try-except` statement, and some information is output using `print`

## Requirements

- You should have more than one exception handler.
