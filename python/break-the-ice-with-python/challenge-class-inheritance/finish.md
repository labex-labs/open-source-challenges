# Summary

In this challenge, we learned about class inheritance in Python. We defined a parent class `Person` and two child classes `Male` and `Female`, and used the `getGender` method to print out the gender of each object. We also used the `Subclass(Parentclass)` syntax to define the child classes. Class inheritance is a powerful tool in object-oriented programming that allows for code reuse and organization.
