# Class Inheritance

Define a class `Person` and its two child classes: `Male` and `Female`. All classes have a method `getGender` which can print `"Male"` for `Male` class and `"Female"` for `Female` class.

## Example

The output section of the program is as follows:

```bash
print(aMale.getGender())
print(aFemale.getGender())
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
Male
Female
```

## Hints

- Use `Subclass(Parentclass)` to define a child class.
