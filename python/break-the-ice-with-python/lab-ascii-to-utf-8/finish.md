# Summary

This lab requires us to write a program that can convert an ASCII string to a unicode string encoded by utf-8. The program should take an ASCII string as input and output the corresponding utf-8 encoded string. We can use the `input()` function to get the string to convert and the `encode()` function to perform the conversion.
