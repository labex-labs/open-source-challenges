# Remove Even Numbers from List

Please write a program to print the list after removing even numbers in [5,6,77,45,22,12,24].

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
[5, 6, 77, 45, 22, 12, 24]
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[5, 77, 45]
```

## Hints

- Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.
