# Summary

To measure the execution time of a program in Python, we can use the `time.time()` function. In this lab, we are asked to write a program that prints the running time of executing "1+1" for 10000000 times. The output of the program is a single number representing the time taken in seconds. By using the `time.time()` function, we can easily measure the execution time of any program and use this information to optimize our code or compare different algorithms.
