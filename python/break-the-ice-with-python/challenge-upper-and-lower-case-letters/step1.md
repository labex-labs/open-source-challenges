# Upper and Lower Case Letters

Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
Hello world!
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- Consider using the `isupper()` and `islower()` methods to determine the case of letters.
