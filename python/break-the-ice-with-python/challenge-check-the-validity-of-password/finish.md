# Summary

The program accepts a sequence of comma-separated passwords and checks each one to see if it meets the criteria. If a password matches the criteria, it is printed, separated by a comma. The program uses methods such as `isupper()`, `islower()`, and `isnumeric()` to determine the type of character in the password.
