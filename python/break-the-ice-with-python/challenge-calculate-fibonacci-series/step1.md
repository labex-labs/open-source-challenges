# Calculate Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:

```bash
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
```

Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.

## Example

If the following n is given as input to the program:

```bash
7
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
13
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- We can define recursive function in Python.
