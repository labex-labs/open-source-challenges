# Generate a Number List

Please write a program to generate a list with 5 random numbers between 100 and 200 inclusive.

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
range(100,201)
```

Then, the output of the program may be:

```bash
[133, 110, 196, 172, 177]
```

## Hints

- Use `range()` to generate an iterable object.
- Use `random.sample()` to generate a list of random values.
