# Generate Random Even Number

Please write a program to output a random even number between 0 and 10 inclusive using random module and list comprehension.

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
range(0,11,2)
```

Then, the output of the program may be:

```bash
6
```

## Hints

- Use `range()` to generate an iterable object.
- Use `random.choice()` to a random element from a list.
