# Summary

To compute a recursive function in Python, we can define a function that calls itself during its execution. In this challenge, we are given a function f(n) that computes the sum of f(n-1) and 100, with f(0) being 0. We can use recursion to compute f(n) by calling the function recursively with n-1 until we reach the base case of f(0). Once we reach the base case, we can return the final value of f(n). By using recursion, we can simplify the computation of complex functions and make our code more readable.
