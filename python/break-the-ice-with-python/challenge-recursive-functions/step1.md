# Recursive Functions

Write a program to compute:

```bash
f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
and f(0)=0
```

With a given n input by console (n>0).

## Example

If the following n is given as input to the program:

```bash
5
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
500
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- We can define recursive function in Python.
