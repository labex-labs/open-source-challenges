# Use of Map

Write a program which can `map()` to make a list whose elements are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
range(1, 21)
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400]
```

## Hints

- Use `map()` to generate a list.
