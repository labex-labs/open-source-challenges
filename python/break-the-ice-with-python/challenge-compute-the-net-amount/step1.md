# Compute the Net Amount

Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input.

The transaction log format is shown as following:

```bash
D 100
W 200
```

- D means deposit while W means withdrawal.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
500
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
