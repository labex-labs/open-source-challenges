# Summary

To summarize, we have shown you how to use `map()` and `filter()` to create a new list containing the squares of even numbers in a given list. By using these functions, you can easily manipulate and filter the elements of a list. We hope this article has been helpful in demonstrating the power of these functions in Python.
