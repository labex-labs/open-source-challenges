# Use of Map and Filter

Write a program which can `map()` and `filter()` to make a list whose elements are square of even number in `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

## Hints

- Use `map()` to generate a list.
- Use `filter()` to filter elements of a list.
