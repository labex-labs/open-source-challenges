# Square each Odd Number

Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
1,9,25,49,81
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
