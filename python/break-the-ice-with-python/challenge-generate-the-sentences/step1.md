# Generate the Sentences

Please write a program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["I", "You"] and verb is in ["Play", "Love"] and the object is in ["Hockey","Football"].

## Example

If you are given the following lists:

```bash
["I", "You"]
["Play", "Love"]
["Hockey","Football"]
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
I Play Hockey
I Play Football
I Love Hockey
I Love Football
You Play Hockey
You Play Football
You Love Hockey
You Love Football
```

## Hints

- Use `list[index]` notation to get a element from a list.
