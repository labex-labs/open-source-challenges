# Summary

We have successfully defined a `Circle` class that can be constructed by a radius and has a method named `area` which can compute the area. The `area` method uses the formula `pi * r^2` to calculate the area of the circle. We have also provided an example input and output to demonstrate the functionality of the `Circle` class.
