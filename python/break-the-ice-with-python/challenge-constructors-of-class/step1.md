# Constructors of Class

Define a class named `Circle` which can be constructed by a radius. The `Circle` class has a method named `area` which can compute the area.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
5
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
78.54
```

## Hints

- Use `def methodName(self)` to define a method.
