# Generate a List and a Tuple

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generates a list and a tuple which contains every number.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
34,67,55,33,12,98
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- Consider using `input.tuple()` method can convert list to tuple.
