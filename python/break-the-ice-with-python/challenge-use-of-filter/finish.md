# Summary

To create a list of even numbers between 1 and 20, we can use the `filter()` function in Python. We simply need to define a lambda function that checks if a number is even, and then pass this function along with the `range()` function to `filter()`. The resulting filtered list will contain only the even numbers between 1 and 20. This is a simple and efficient way to extract specific elements from a list based on a certain condition.
