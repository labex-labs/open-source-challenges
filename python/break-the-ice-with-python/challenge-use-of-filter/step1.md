# Use of Filter

Write a program which can `filter()` to make a list whose elements are even number between 1 and 20 (both included).

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
range(1, 21)
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```

## Hints

- Use `filter()` to filter elements of a list.
