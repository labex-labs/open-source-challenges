# Summary

To summarize, we have defined a class with two methods: `getString` and `printString`. The `getString` method is used to get a string from console input, while the `printString` method is used to print the string in upper case. We have also included a simple test function to test the class methods. The `__init__` method is used to construct some parameters.
