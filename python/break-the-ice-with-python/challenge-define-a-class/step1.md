# Define a Class

Define a class which has at least two methods:

- getString: to get a string from console input.
- printString: to print the string in upper case.

Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
hello python!
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
HELLO PYTHON!
```

## Hints

- Use `__init__` method to construct some parameters
