# Remove all Duplicate Words

Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
again and hello makes perfect practice world
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- We use `remove()` to remove duplicated data and then use `sort()` to sort the data.
