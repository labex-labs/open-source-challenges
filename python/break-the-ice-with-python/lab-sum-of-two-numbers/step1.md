# Sum of Two Numbers

Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.

## Preparation

Before we start writing the code, we should open the `/home/labex/project/sum_of_two_numbers.py` file in WebIDE.

## Start writing code

Then input the following code.

```python
def sum_of_two_numbers(number1, number2):
    return number1 + number2


print(sum_of_two_numbers(1, 2))

```

This Python code defines a function called `sum_of_two_numbers()` that takes two number arguments `number1` and `number2`, adds them together using the `+` operator, and returns the resulting sum using the `return` statement.

The code then calls the `sum_of_two_numbers()` function with the arguments `1` and `2` using the `print()` function to output the resulting sum to the console.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to define and call a function that performs arithmetic operations on number arguments in Python. It also shows how to use the `return` statement to return a value from a function.

## Test your code

You can run the following command in the terminal to execute.

```bash
python3 /home/labex/project/sum_of_two_numbers.py
```

Or you can just click the button like this ![Run Python File](./assets/run_python_file_button.jpg "Run Python File") in the top right corner to execute.

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
3
```

At this point, your code is running successfully!
