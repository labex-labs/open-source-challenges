# Capitalize Characters

Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
