# Remove a Number from List

By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the value 24 in [12,24,35,24,88,120,155].

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
[12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155]
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[12, 35, 88, 120, 155]
```

## Hints

- Use list's `remove()` method to delete a value, but this will remove only the first occurrence of 24.
