# Remove Duplicate Numbers from List

With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.

## Example

If you are given the following list:

```bash
[12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155, 88, 120, 155]
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
[12, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155]
```

## Hints

- Use `remove()` to remove an item from a list.
