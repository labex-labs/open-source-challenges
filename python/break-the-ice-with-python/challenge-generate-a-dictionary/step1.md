# Generate a Dictionary

With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i x i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). And then the program should print the dictionary.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
8
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the program, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- Consider using `dict()`.
