# Calculate Mathematical Expression

Please write a program which accepts basic mathematic expression from console and print the evaluation result.

## Example

If the following basic mathematic expression is given as input to the program:

```bash
35 + 3
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
38
```

## Hints

- In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
- Use `eval()` to evaluate an expression.
