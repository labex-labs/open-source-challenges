# Print the Longest String

Define a function that can accept two strings as input and print the string with maximum length in console. If two strings have the same length, then the function should print all strings line by line.

## Example

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```bash
abcdef 1234
```

Then, the output of the program should be:

```bash
abcdef
```

## Hints

- Use `len()` function to get the length of a string.
