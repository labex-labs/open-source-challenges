# Introduction

In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. A linked list is a dynamic data structure, which means that we can add or remove elements from it at any time. In this challenge, we will be looking at how to find the start of a linked list loop.
