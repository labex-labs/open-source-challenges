# Palindrome

## Problem

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome. A linked list is a palindrome if the sequence of elements in the list is the same forward and backward.

## Requirements

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following requirements:

- The linked list is non-circular and singly linked.
- A single character or number is not considered a palindrome.
- We already have a linked list class that can be used for this problem.
- We can use additional data structures.
- The linked list fits in memory.

## Example Usage

Here are some examples of how the function should behave:

- An empty list should return False.
- A single element list should return False.
- A list with two or more elements that is not a palindrome should return False.
- A palindrome with an even length should return True.
- A palindrome with an odd length should return True.
