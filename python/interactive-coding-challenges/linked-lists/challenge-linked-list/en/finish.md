# Summary

In summary, a linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The linked list implementation should have insert, append, find, delete, length, and print methods, and meet the requirements of being non-circular and singly linked, only keeping track of the head of the list, and disallowing None values. The example usage provides scenarios for each method to illustrate their functionality.
