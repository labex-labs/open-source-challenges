# Delete Mid

## Problem

Given a non-circular, singly linked list, delete a node in the middle of the list, given only access to that node. If the final node is being deleted, make it a dummy with value None. You can assume that we already have a linked list class that can be used for this problem.

## Requirements

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following requirements:

- The linked list is non-circular and singly linked.
- If the final node is being deleted, make it a dummy with value None.
- We already have a linked list class that can be used for this problem.

## Example Usage

Here are some examples of how to use this function:

- Deleting on an empty list should return None.
- Deleting None should return None.
- Deleting on a list with one node should return [None].
- Deleting on a list with multiple nodes should return the updated list with the node deleted.
