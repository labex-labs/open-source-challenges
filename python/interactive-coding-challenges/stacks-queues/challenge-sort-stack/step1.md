# Sort Stack

## Problem

Given a stack, write a function to sort it in ascending order. You can use another stack as a buffer. The sorted stack should have the largest element at the top.

## Requirements

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following requirements:

- The largest element should be at the top of the sorted stack.
- The stack can have duplicate values.
- We can assume that we already have a stack class that can be used for this problem.
- We can assume that the stack fits in memory.

## Example Usage

Here are some examples of how the function should behave:

- Empty stack -> None
- One element stack -> The same element
- Two or more element stack (general case) -> Sorted stack in ascending order
- Already sorted stack -> The same stack
