# N Stacks

## Problem

Implement n stacks using a single array. The stacks and array are fixed size and equally sized. Pushing to a full stack results in an exception, and popping from an empty stack also results in an exception. We can assume the user passed in stack index is valid, and that this fits memory.

## Requirements

To implement n stacks using a single array, we need to meet the following requirements:

- The stacks and array are fixed size.
- The stacks are equally sized.
- Pushing to a full stack results in an exception.
- Popping from an empty stack results in an exception.
- We can assume the user passed in stack index is valid.
- We can assume this fits memory.

## Example Usage

To test the implementation of n stacks using a single array, we can perform the following actions on the three stacks:

- Push to full stack -> Exception
- Push to non-full stack
- Pop on empty stack -> Exception
- Pop on non-empty stack
