  "title": "Set of Stacks",
  "description": "In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. In some cases, we may need to implement a set of stacks, where each stack has a limited capacity. When a stack reaches its capacity, a new stack is created to store additional elements. In this challenge, we will implement a SetOfStacks class that wraps a list of stacks, where each stack is bound by a capacity.",
