# Pairwise Swap

## Problem

Given a positive integer, swap the odd and even bits with as few operations as possible. For example, if the input is `1001 1111 0110`, the output should be `0110 1111 1001`.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met:

- The input is always a positive integer.
- The program works with 32 bits.
- The output is an integer.
- The inputs are valid (not None).
- The program fits memory.

## Example Usage

The following examples illustrate the usage of the program:

- None -> Exception
- 0 -> 0
- -1 -> -1
- General case:

```
    input  = 1001 1111 0110
    result = 0110 1111 1001
```
