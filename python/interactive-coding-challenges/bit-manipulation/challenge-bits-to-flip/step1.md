# Bits To Flip

## Problem

Given two integers A and B, determine the number of bits to flip to convert A to B. For example, if A = 11101 and B = 01111, the number of bits to flip is 2.

## Requirements

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following requirements:

- A and B are always integers.
- The output is always an integer.
- A and B are always the same number of bits.
- The inputs may not be valid (None).
- The solution should fit in memory.

## Example Usage

Here are some examples of how to use this function:

- If A or B is None, an exception should be raised.
- If A = 11101 and B = 01111, the number of bits to flip is 2.
