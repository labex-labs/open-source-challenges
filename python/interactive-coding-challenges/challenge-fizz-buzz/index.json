  "description": "Fizz Buzz is a popular programming challenge that is often used in coding interviews. It is a simple game that requires players to take turns counting up from 1, replacing any number that is divisible by 3 with the word \"Fizz\" and any number that is divisible by 5 with the word \"Buzz\". If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player must say \"FizzBuzz\" instead of the number. In this challenge, we will be implementing Fizz Buzz using Python.",
