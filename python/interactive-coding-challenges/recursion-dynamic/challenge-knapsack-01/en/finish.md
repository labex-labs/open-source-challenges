# Summary

The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that is used in many real-world applications. It is a problem of combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to select items to maximize the value while keeping the weight within the capacity of the knapsack. To solve the problem, we need to consider several requirements, such as the fact that items cannot be replaced once they are placed in the knapsack and that we cannot split an item. The problem is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm that can solve it optimally for all cases.
