# Summary

In summary, the problem of generating all valid combinations of n-pairs of parentheses is a classic problem in computer science. To solve this problem, we need to find all valid combinations of n-pairs of parentheses, where each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested. The output should be a list of valid combinations without duplicates.
