# Summary

In summary, the Fibonacci sequence is a popular problem in computer science and mathematics. The problem is to implement the sequence in three different ways: recursively, dynamically, and iteratively. The program should start at 0 and 1, and the inputs should be valid non-negative integers. Both recursive and iterative solutions should be implemented, and the program should fit in memory.
