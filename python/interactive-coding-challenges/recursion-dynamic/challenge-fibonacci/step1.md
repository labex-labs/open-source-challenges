# Fibonacci

## Problem

The problem is to implement the Fibonacci sequence in three different ways: recursively, dynamically, and iteratively. The sequence should start at 0 and 1, and the inputs are valid non-negative integers. Both recursive and iterative solutions should be implemented. The program should fit in memory.

## Requirements

To solve this problem, the following requirements should be met:

- The sequence should start at 0 and 1.
- The inputs are valid non-negative integers.
- The program should implement both recursive and iterative solutions.
- The program should fit in memory.

## Example

The following are the expected outputs for some input values:

- n = 0 -> 0
- n = 1 -> 1
- n = 6 -> 8
- Fib sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...
