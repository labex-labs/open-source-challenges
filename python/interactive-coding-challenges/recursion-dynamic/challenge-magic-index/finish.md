# Summary

In summary, the magic index problem involves finding an element in a sorted array such that its value is equal to its index. The function must return the left-most magic index if there are multiple ones, and -1 if there is no magic index. The requirements for the function include a sorted array, the possibility of duplicate elements, and the allowance of negative values.
