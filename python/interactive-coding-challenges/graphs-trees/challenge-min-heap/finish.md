# Summary

In summary, a min heap is a binary tree data structure that maintains the heap property, where the parent node is always less than or equal to its children. The implementation of a min heap should include the `extract_min()` and `insert(value)` methods, and meet the requirements of integer inputs and fitting in memory.
