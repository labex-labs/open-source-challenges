# Introduction

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself (so if v has a direct connection from w, w is the lowest common ancestor). In this challenge, we will find the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree.
