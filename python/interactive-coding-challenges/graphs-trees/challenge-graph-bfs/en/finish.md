# Summary

In summary, BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. To implement BFS on a graph, the graph must be directed, connected, and the inputs must be valid. The order in which the vertices are visited is important, as it determines the shortest path from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
