# Trie

## Problem

Your task is to implement a trie with the following methods:

- `find(word)` - returns `True` if the given word is in the trie, `False` otherwise.
- `insert(word)` - inserts the given word into the trie.
- `remove(word)` - removes the given word from the trie.
- `list_words()` - returns a list of all words in the trie that end with a terminating character.

## Requirements

To complete this challenge, the following requirements must be met:

- The implementation should work with strings.
- The strings are assumed to be in ASCII.
- The `find` method should only match exact words with a terminating character.
- The `list_words` method should only return words with a terminating character.
- It is assumed that the implementation fits memory.

## Example Usage

The following examples demonstrate the usage of the trie methods:

```txt

         root
       /  |  \
      h   a*  m
     / \   \   \
    a   e*  t*  e*
   / \         / \
  s*  t*      n*  t*
             /
            s*

find

* Find on an empty trie
* Find non-matching
* Find matching

insert

* Insert on empty trie
* Insert to make a leaf terminator char
* Insert to extend an existing terminator char

remove

* Remove me
* Remove mens
* Remove a
* Remove has

list_words

* List empty
* List general case
```
