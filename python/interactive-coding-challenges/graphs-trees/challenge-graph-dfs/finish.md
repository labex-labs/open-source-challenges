# Summary

In this challenge, we implemented depth-first search on a directed graph. The algorithm starts at a given node and visits all reachable nodes in the graph. The order in which the nodes are visited is recorded and returned as a list. By meeting the requirements, we can ensure the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.
