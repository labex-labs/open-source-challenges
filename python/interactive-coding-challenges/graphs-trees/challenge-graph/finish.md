# Summary

In this challenge, we implemented a graph that can be directed or undirected, have weighted edges, and cycles. We also ensured that adding or deleting nodes that already exist or do not exist respectively, does not affect the graph. The Graph class can be used as a building block for more complex graph challenges.
