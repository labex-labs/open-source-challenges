# Summary

Inverting a binary tree is a common problem in computer science. By swapping all left and right node pairs, we can create a new tree that is the mirror image of the original tree. To solve this problem, we need to have a Node class that represents a node in the binary tree, and we need to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
