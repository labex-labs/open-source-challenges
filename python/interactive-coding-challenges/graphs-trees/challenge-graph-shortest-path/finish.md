# Summary

The shortest path problem is a fundamental problem in network optimization. To solve this problem, we need to consider the requirements of the graph, such as whether it is directional, whether it has cycles, and whether the edges are weighted. We can use the ShortestPath class to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
