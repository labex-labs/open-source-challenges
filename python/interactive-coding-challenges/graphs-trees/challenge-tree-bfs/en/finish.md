# Summary

In this Python challenge, we implemented breadth-first traversal on a binary tree. The solution required a Node class with an insert method, and the `visit_func` method was called on each node when it was processed. The solution was able to fit in memory and produced the correct sequence of nodes when performing a breadth-first traversal on a binary tree.
