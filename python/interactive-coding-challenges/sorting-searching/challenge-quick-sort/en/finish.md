# Summary

Quick Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array or a list. The algorithm works by partitioning the list into two sub-lists, then recursively sorting the sub-lists. The Quick Sort algorithm is efficient and simple, making it widely used. To implement Quick Sort in Python, the algorithm should meet the requirements of not being an in-place solution, handling duplicate elements, handling invalid input, and being able to handle lists of any size.
