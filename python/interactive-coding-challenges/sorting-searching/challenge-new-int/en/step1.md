# Find Missing Integer

## Problem

Given an array of 32 non-negative integers, find an integer that is not present in the input array. The solution should use minimal memory.

## Requirements

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following requirements:

- The input array contains non-negative integers.
- The range of the integers is not specified, but we need to discuss the approach for 4 billion integers.
- We need to implement the solution for an array of 32 integers.
- We cannot assume that the input array is valid.

## Example Usage

Here are some examples of how the function should behave:

- If the input is None or an empty array, the function should raise an exception.
- If there is an integer excluded from the input array, the function should return that integer.
- If there isn't an integer excluded from the input array, the function should return None.
