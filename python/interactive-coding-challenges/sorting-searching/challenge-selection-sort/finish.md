# Summary

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and putting it at the beginning. It is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, but it is easy to understand and implement. The algorithm can handle duplicate elements and invalid input. By meeting the requirements, we can implement selection sort in Python and use it to sort lists of integers.
