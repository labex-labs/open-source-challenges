# Summary

Insertion sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works well for small lists or partially sorted lists. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, but it can be faster than other sorting algorithms for small lists or partially sorted lists. The algorithm works by repeatedly inserting the next element in the sorted array, building the final sorted array one item at a time. The implementation of insertion sort in Python should meet the requirements mentioned above and handle invalid input gracefully.
