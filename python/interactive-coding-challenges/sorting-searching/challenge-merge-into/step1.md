# Merge Into

## Problem

Given two sorted arrays A and B, merge B into A in sorted order. The arrays may contain duplicate items, and the inputs may not be valid. The inputs will also include the actual size of A and B, and we can assume that this fits in memory.

To solve this problem, we need to consider whether A has enough space for B, and whether the inputs have duplicate array items. If A does not have enough space for B, we may need to allocate additional memory. If the inputs have duplicate array items, we need to ensure that these duplicates are handled correctly during the merge.

## Requirements

To solve this problem, we need to meet the following requirements:

- Ensure that A has enough space for B
- Handle duplicate array items correctly
- Check that the inputs are valid
- Include the actual size of A and B in the inputs
- Assume that the inputs fit in memory

## Example Usage

To illustrate how this problem can be solved, consider the following examples:

- If A or B is None, an exception should be raised.
- If the index of the last element in A or B is less than 0, an exception should be raised.
- If A or B is empty, the result should be A or B, respectively.
- In the general case, we can merge B into A as follows:

```
A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, None, None, None]
B = [4, 5, 6]
A = [1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9]
```
