Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various fields. It involves manipulating individual bits that make up a binary number. In Python, we can perform common bit manipulation operations such as getting a bit, setting a bit, clearing a bit, and updating a bit. In this challenge, we will implement these operations.
