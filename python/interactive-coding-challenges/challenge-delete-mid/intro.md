# Introduction

In Python, a linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. Deleting a node in the middle of a linked list can be a challenging task, especially when we only have access to that node. In this challenge, we will explore how to delete a node in the middle of a linked list, given only access to that node.
