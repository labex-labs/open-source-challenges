# Introduction

In computer science, bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Bit manipulation is used in cryptography, error detection and correction algorithms, digital signal processing, and many other fields. In this challenge, we will determine the number of bits to flip to convert int a to int b.
