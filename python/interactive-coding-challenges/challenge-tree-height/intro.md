# Introduction

In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a set of linked nodes. Each node in a tree has a parent node and zero or more child nodes. The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node in the tree. In this challenge, we will determine the height of a binary tree.
