# Introduction

In computer science, the XOR operation (exclusive or) takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 or only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. In this challenge, we will be maximizing the XOR operation between two integers.
