# Summary

In summary, this challenge requires us to compress a string in a specific way to save space. We must ensure that the compressed string is shorter than the original string, otherwise we return the original string. The requirements for this challenge include using ASCII strings, being case sensitive, allowing additional data structures, and assuming the string fits in memory.
