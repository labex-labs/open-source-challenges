# Two Sum

## Problem

Given an array of integers, find the two indices that sum to a specific value. The function should return the indices as a list.

## Requirements

To solve the Two Sum problem, the following requirements must be met:

- There is exactly one solution.
- There is always a solution.
- The array is an array of integers.
- The array is not sorted.
- Negative values are possible.
- The inputs are not necessarily valid.
- The solution must fit in memory.

## Example Usage

The Two Sum problem can be solved using the following example:

- None input -> TypeError
- [] -> ValueError
- [1, 3, 2, -7, 5], 7 -> [2, 4]
