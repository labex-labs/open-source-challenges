# Summary

In this challenge, we implemented a priority queue backed by an array. The priority queue supports `insert`, `extract_min`, and `decrease_key` methods. We ensured that there are no duplicate keys in the priority queue, and the inputs don't need to be validated. The priority queue fits into memory.
