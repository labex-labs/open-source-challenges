# Summary

In this challenge, we implemented Fizz Buzz using Python. We defined a function that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of strings representing the numbers from 1 to n, with modifications for multiples of 3, 5, and both. We also handled cases where the input is not a valid integer or is less than 1 by raising exceptions.
