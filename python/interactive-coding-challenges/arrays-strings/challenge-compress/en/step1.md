# Compress

## Problem

Given a string, compress it such that 'AAABCCDDDD' becomes 'A3BC2D4'. The compressed string should only be returned if it saves space. If the compressed string is longer than the original string, return the original string. The string is case sensitive and can be assumed to be ASCII. Additional data structures can be used and it can be assumed that the string fits in memory.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met:

- The string is ASCII.
- The string is case sensitive.
- Additional data structures can be used.
- The string fits in memory.

## Example Usage

The following examples demonstrate the expected input and output of the function:

- None -> None
- '' -> ''
- 'AABBCC' -> 'AABBCC'
- 'AAABCCDDDD' -> 'A3BC2D4'
