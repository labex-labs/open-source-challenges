# Exercise 4.4: Using your class

Modify the `read_portfolio()` function in the `report.py` program so that it reads a portfolio into a list of `Stock` instances as just shown in Exercise 4.3. Once you have done that, fix all of the code in `report.py` and `pcost.py` so that it works with `Stock` instances instead of dictionaries.

Hint: You should not have to make major changes to the code. You will mainly be changing dictionary access such as `s['shares']` into `s.shares`.

You should be able to run your functions the same as before:

```python
>>> import pcost
>>> pcost.portfolio_cost('Data/portfolio.csv')
44671.15
>>> import report
>>> report.portfolio_report('Data/portfolio.csv', 'Data/prices.csv')
      Name     Shares      Price     Change
