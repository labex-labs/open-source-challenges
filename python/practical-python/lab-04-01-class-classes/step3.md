# Instances

Instances are the actual _objects_ that you manipulate in your program.

They are created by calling the class as a function.

```python
>>> a = Player(2, 3)
>>> b = Player(10, 20)
>>>
```

`a` and `b` are instances of `Player`.

_Emphasize: The class statement is just the definition (it does nothing by itself). Similar to a function definition._
