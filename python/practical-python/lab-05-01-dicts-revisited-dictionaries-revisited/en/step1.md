# Dictionaries, Revisited

Remember that a dictionary is a collection of named values.

```python
stock = {
    'name' : 'GOOG',
    'shares' : 100,
    'price' : 490.1
}
```

Dictionaries are commonly used for simple data structures. However, they are used for critical parts of the interpreter and may be the _most important type of data in Python_.
