# Exercise 2.18: Tabulating with Counters

Suppose you wanted to tabulate the total number of shares of each stock. This is easy using `Counter` objects. Try it:

```python
>>> portfolio = read_portfolio('Data/portfolio.csv')
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> holdings = Counter()
>>> for s in portfolio:
        holdings[s['name']] += s['shares']

>>> holdings
Counter({'MSFT': 250, 'IBM': 150, 'CAT': 150, 'AA': 100, 'GE': 95})
>>>
```

Carefully observe how the multiple entries for `MSFT` and `IBM` in `portfolio` get combined into a single entry here.

You can use a Counter just like a dictionary to retrieve individual values:

```python
>>> holdings['IBM']
150
>>> holdings['MSFT']
250
>>>
```

If you want to rank the values, do this:

```python
>>> # Get three most held stocks
>>> holdings.most_common(3)
[('MSFT', 250), ('IBM', 150), ('CAT', 150)]
>>>
```

Let's grab another portfolio of stocks and make a new Counter:

```python
>>> portfolio2 = read_portfolio('Data/portfolio2.csv')
>>> holdings2 = Counter()
>>> for s in portfolio2:
          holdings2[s['name']] += s['shares']

>>> holdings2
Counter({'HPQ': 250, 'GE': 125, 'AA': 50, 'MSFT': 25})
>>>
```

Finally, let's combine all of the holdings doing one simple operation:

```python
>>> holdings
Counter({'MSFT': 250, 'IBM': 150, 'CAT': 150, 'AA': 100, 'GE': 95})
>>> holdings2
Counter({'HPQ': 250, 'GE': 125, 'AA': 50, 'MSFT': 25})
>>> combined = holdings + holdings2
>>> combined
Counter({'MSFT': 275, 'HPQ': 250, 'GE': 220, 'AA': 150, 'IBM': 150, 'CAT': 150})
>>>
```

This is only a small taste of what counters provide. However, if you ever find yourself needing to tabulate values, you should consider using one.
