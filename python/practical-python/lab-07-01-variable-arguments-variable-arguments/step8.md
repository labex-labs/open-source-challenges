# Exercise 7.4: Argument pass-through

The `fileparse.parse_csv()` function has some options for changing the file delimiter and for error reporting. Maybe you'd like to expose those options to the `read_portfolio()` function above. Make this change:

    def read_portfolio(filename, **opts):
        '''
        Read a stock portfolio file into a list of dictionaries with keys
        name, shares, and price.
        '''
        with open(filename) as lines:
            portdicts = fileparse.parse_csv(lines,
                                            select=['name','shares','price'],
                                            types=[str,int,float],
                                            **opts)

        portfolio = [ Stock(**d) for d in portdicts ]
        return Portfolio(portfolio)

Once you've made the change, trying reading a file with some errors:

```python
>>> import report
>>> port = report.read_portfolio('Data/missing.csv')
Row 4: Couldn't convert ['MSFT', '', '51.23']
Row 4: Reason invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
Row 7: Couldn't convert ['IBM', '', '70.44']
Row 7: Reason invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
>>>
```

Now, try silencing the errors:

```python
>>> import report
>>> port = report.read_portfolio('Data/missing.csv', silence_errors=True)
>>>
```
