List comprehensions are commonly used in Python as an efficient means for transforming, filtering, or collecting data. Due to the syntax, you don't want to go overboard---try to keep each list comprehension as simple as possible. It's okay to break things into multiple steps. For example, it's not clear that you would want to spring that last example on your unsuspecting co-workers.

That said, knowing how to quickly manipulate data is a skill that's incredibly useful. There are numerous situations where you might have to solve some kind of one-off problem involving data imports, exports, extraction, and so forth. Becoming a guru master of list comprehensions can substantially reduce the time spent devising a solution. Also, don't forget about the `collections` module.
