# Built-in Exceptions

There are about two-dozen built-in exceptions. Usually the name of the exception is indicative of what's wrong (e.g., a `ValueError` is raised because you supplied a bad value). This is not an exhaustive list. Check the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) for more.

```python
