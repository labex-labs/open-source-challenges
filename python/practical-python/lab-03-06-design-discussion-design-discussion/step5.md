# Exercise 3.17: From filenames to file-like objects

You've now created a file `fileparse.py` that contained a function `parse_csv()`. The function worked like this:

```python
>>> import fileparse
>>> portfolio = fileparse.parse_csv('Data/portfolio.csv', types=[str,int,float])
>>>
```

Right now, the function expects to be passed a filename. However, you can make the code more flexible. Modify the function so that it works with any file-like/iterable object. For example:

```python
>>> import fileparse
>>> import gzip
>>> with gzip.open('Data/portfolio.csv.gz', 'rt') as file:
...      port = fileparse.parse_csv(file, types=[str,int,float])
...
>>> lines = ['name,shares,price', 'AA,100,34.23', 'IBM,50,91.1', 'HPE,75,45.1']
>>> port = fileparse.parse_csv(lines, types=[str,int,float])
>>>
```

In this new code, what happens if you pass a filename as before?

```python
>>> port = fileparse.parse_csv('Data/portfolio.csv', types=[str,int,float])
>>> port
... look at output (it should be crazy) ...
>>>
```

Yes, you'll need to be careful. Could you add a safety check to avoid this?
