# Exercise 9.5: Make a package

Take the `porty-app/` code you created for Exercise 9.3 and see if you can recreate the steps described here. Specifically, add a `setup.py` file and a `MANIFEST.in` file to the top-level directory. Create a source distribution file by running `python setup.py sdist`.

As a final step, see if you can install your package into a Python virtual environment.
