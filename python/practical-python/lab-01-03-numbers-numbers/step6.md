# Converting Numbers

The type name can be used to convert values:

```python
a = int(x)    # Convert x to integer
b = float(x)  # Convert x to float
```

Try it out.

```python
>>> a = 3.14159
>>> int(a)
3
>>> b = '3.14159' # It also works with strings containing numbers
>>> float(b)
3.14159
>>>
```

Reminder: These exercises assume you are working in the `practical-python/Work` directory. Look for the file `mortgage.py`.
