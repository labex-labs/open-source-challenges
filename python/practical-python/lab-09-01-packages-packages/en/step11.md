# Exercise 9.1: Making a simple package

Make a directory called `porty/` and put all of the above Python files into it. Additionally create an empty `__init__.py` file and put it in the directory. You should have a directory of files like this:

    porty/
        __init__.py
        fileparse.py
        follow.py
        pcost.py
        portfolio.py
        report.py
        stock.py
        tableformat.py
        ticker.py
        typedproperty.py

Remove the file `__pycache__` that's sitting in your directory. This contains pre-compiled Python modules from before. We want to start fresh.

Try importing some of package modules:

```python
>>> import porty.report
>>> import porty.pcost
>>> import porty.ticker
```

If these imports fail, go into the appropriate file and fix the module imports to include a package-relative import. For example, a statement such as `import fileparse` might change to the following:

    # report.py
    from . import fileparse
    ...

If you have a statement such as `from fileparse import parse_csv`, change the code to the following:

    # report.py
    from .fileparse import parse_csv
    ...
