# Exercise 2.11: Adding some headers

Suppose you had a tuple of header names like this:

```python
headers = ('Name', 'Shares', 'Price', 'Change')
```

Add code to your program that takes the above tuple of headers and creates a string where each header name is right-aligned in a 10-character wide field and each field is separated by a single space.

```python
'      Name     Shares      Price      Change'
```

Write code that takes the headers and creates the separator string between the headers and data to follow. This string is just a bunch of "-" characters under each field name. For example:

```python
'---------- ---------- ---------- -----------'
```

When you're done, your program should produce the table shown at the top of this exercise.

          Name     Shares      Price     Change
    ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
            AA        100       9.22     -22.98
           IBM         50     106.28      15.18
           CAT        150      35.46     -47.98
          MSFT        200      20.89     -30.34
            GE         95      13.48     -26.89
          MSFT         50      20.89     -44.21
           IBM        100     106.28      35.84
