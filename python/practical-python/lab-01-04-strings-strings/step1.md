# Representing Literal Text

String literals are written in programs with quotes.

```python
# Single quote
a = 'Yeah but no but yeah but...'

# Double quote
b = "computer says no"

# Triple quotes
c = '''
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, the eyes, the eyes, the eyes,
not around the eyes,
don't look around the eyes,
look into my eyes, you're under.
'''
```

Normally strings may only span a single line. Triple quotes capture all text enclosed across multiple lines including all formatting.

There is no difference between using single (') versus double (") quotes. _However, the same type of quote used to start a string must be used to terminate it_.
