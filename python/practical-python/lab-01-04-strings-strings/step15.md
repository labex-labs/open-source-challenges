# Exercise 1.16: String Methods

At the Python interactive prompt, try experimenting with some of the string methods.

```python
>>> symbols.lower()
?
>>> symbols
?
>>>
```

Remember, strings are always read-only. If you want to save the result of an operation, you need to place it in a variable:

```python
>>> lowersyms = symbols.lower()
>>>
```

Try some more operations:

```python
>>> symbols.find('MSFT')
?
>>> symbols[13:17]
?
>>> symbols = symbols.replace('SCO','DOA')
>>> symbols
?
>>> name = '   IBM   \n'
>>> name = name.strip()    # Remove surrounding whitespace
>>> name
?
>>>
```
