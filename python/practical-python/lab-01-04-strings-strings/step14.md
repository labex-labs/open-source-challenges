# Exercise 1.15: Membership testing (substring testing)

Experiment with the `in` operator to check for substrings. At the interactive prompt, try these operations:

```python
>>> 'IBM' in symbols
?
>>> 'AA' in symbols
True
>>> 'CAT' in symbols
?
>>>
```

_Why did the check for `'AA'` return `True`?_
