# Sequence Datatypes

Python has three _sequence_ datatypes.

- String: `'Hello'`. A string is a sequence of characters.
- List: `[1, 4, 5]`.
- Tuple: `('GOOG', 100, 490.1)`.

All sequences are ordered, indexed by integers, and have a length.

```python
a = 'Hello'               # String
b = [1, 4, 5]             # List
c = ('GOOG', 100, 490.1)  # Tuple

# Indexed order
a[0]                      # 'H'
b[-1]                     # 5
c[1]                      # 100

# Length of sequence
len(a)                    # 5
len(b)                    # 3
len(c)                    # 3
```

Sequences can be replicated: `s * n`.

```python
>>> a = 'Hello'
>>> a * 3
'HelloHelloHello'
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b * 2
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
>>>
```

Sequences of the same type can be concatenated: `s + t`.

```python
>>> a = (1, 2, 3)
>>> b = (4, 5)
>>> a + b
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
>>>
>>> c = [1, 5]
>>> a + c

TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "list") to tuple
```
