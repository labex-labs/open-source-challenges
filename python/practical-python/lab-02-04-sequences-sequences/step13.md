# Exercise 2.14: More sequence operations

Interactively experiment with some of the sequence reduction operations.

```python
>>> data = [4, 9, 1, 25, 16, 100, 49]
>>> min(data)
1
>>> max(data)
100
>>> sum(data)
204
>>>
```

Try looping over the data.

```python
>>> for x in data:
        print(x)

4
9
...
>>> for n, x in enumerate(data):
        print(n, x)

0 4
1 9
2 1
...
>>>
```

Sometimes the `for` statement, `len()`, and `range()` get used by novices in some kind of horrible code fragment that looks like it emerged from the depths of a rusty C program.

```python
>>> for n in range(len(data)):
        print(data[n])

4
9
1
...
>>>
```

Don't do that! Not only does reading it make everyone's eyes bleed, it's inefficient with memory and it runs a lot slower. Just use a normal `for` loop if you want to iterate over data. Use `enumerate()` if you happen to need the index for some reason.
