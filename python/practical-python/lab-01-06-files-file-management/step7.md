# Commentary: Shouldn't we being using Pandas for this?

Data scientists are quick to point out that libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) already have a function for reading CSV files. This is true--and it works pretty well. However, this is not a course on learning Pandas. Reading files is a more general problem than the specifics of CSV files. The main reason we're working with a CSV file is that it's a familiar format to most coders and it's relatively easy to work with directly--illustrating many Python features in the process. So, by all means use Pandas when you go back to work. For the rest of this course however, we're going to stick with standard Python functionality.
