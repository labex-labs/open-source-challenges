# Exercise 1.27: Reading a data file

Now that you know how to read a file, let's write a program to perform a simple calculation.

The columns in `portfolio.csv` correspond to the stock name, number of shares, and purchase price of a single stock holding. Write a program called `pcost.py` that opens this file, reads all lines, and calculates how much it cost to purchase all of the shares in the portfolio.

_Hint: to convert a string to an integer, use `int(s)`. To convert a string to a floating point, use `float(s)`._

Your program should print output such as the following:

```bash
Total cost 44671.15
```
