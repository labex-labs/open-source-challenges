# Case Sensitivity

Python is case sensitive. Upper and lower-case letters are considered different letters. These are all different variables:

```python
name = 'Jake'
Name = 'Elwood'
NAME = 'Guido'
```

Language statements are always lower-case.

```python
while x < 0:   # OK
WHILE x < 0:   # ERROR
```
