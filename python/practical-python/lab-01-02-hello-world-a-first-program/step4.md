# Running Programs

To execute a program, run it in the terminal with the `python` command. For example, in command-line Unix:

```bash
$ python hello.py
hello world
bash %
```

Or from the Windows shell:

    C:\SomeFolder>hello.py
    hello world

    C:\SomeFolder>c:\python36\python hello.py
    hello world

Note: On Windows, you may need to specify a full path to the Python interpreter such as `c:\python36\python`. However, if Python is installed in its usual way, you might be able to just type the name of the program such as `hello.py`.
