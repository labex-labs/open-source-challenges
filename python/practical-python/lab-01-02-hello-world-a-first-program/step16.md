# User input

To read a line of typed user input, use the `input()` function:

```python
name = input('Enter your name:')
print('Your name is', name)
```

`input` prints a prompt to the user and returns their response. This is useful for small programs, learning exercises or simple debugging. It is not widely used for real programs.
