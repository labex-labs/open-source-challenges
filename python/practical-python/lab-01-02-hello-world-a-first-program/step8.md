# Variables

A variable is a name for a value. You can use letters (lower and upper-case) from a to z. As well as the character underscore `_`. Numbers can also be part of the name of a variable, except as the first character.

```python
height = 442 # valid
_height = 442 # valid
height2 = 442 # valid
2height = 442 # invalid
```
