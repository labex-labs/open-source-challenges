# Exercise 1.5: The Bouncing Ball

A rubber ball is dropped from a height of 100 meters and each time it hits the ground, it bounces back up to 3/5 the height it fell. Write a program `bounce.py` that prints a table showing the height of the first 10 bounces.

Your program should make a table that looks something like this:

```code
1 60.0
2 36.0
3 21.599999999999998
4 12.959999999999999
5 7.775999999999999
6 4.6655999999999995
7 2.7993599999999996
8 1.6796159999999998
9 1.0077695999999998
10 0.6046617599999998
```

_Note: You can clean up the output a bit if you use the round() function. Try using it to round the output to 4 digits._

```code
1 60.0
2 36.0
3 21.6
4 12.96
5 7.776
6 4.6656
7 2.7994
8 1.6796
9 1.0078
10 0.6047
```
