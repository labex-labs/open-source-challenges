# Running Python

Python programs always run inside an interpreter.

The interpreter is a "console-based" application that normally runs from a command shell.

```bash
python3
Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5050, Mar 21 2017, 01:21:04)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

Expert programmers usually have no problem using the interpreter in this way, but it's not so user-friendly for beginners. You may be using an environment that provides a different interface to Python. That's fine, but learning how to run Python terminal is still a useful skill to know.
