# Types

Variables do not need to be declared with the type of the value. The type is associated with the value on the right hand side, not name of the variable.

```python
height = 442           # An integer
height = 442.0         # Floating point
height = 'Really tall' # A string
```

Python is dynamically typed. The perceived "type" of a variable might change as a program executes depending on the current value assigned to it.
