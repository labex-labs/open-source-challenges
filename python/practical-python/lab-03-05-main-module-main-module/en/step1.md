# Main Functions

In many programming languages, there is a concept of a _main_ function or method.

```c
// c / c++
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    ...
}
```

```java
// java
class myprog {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        ...
    }
}
```

This is the first function that executes when an application is launched.
