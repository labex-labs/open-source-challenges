# Some Dangers

If you don't know about this sharing, you will shoot yourself in the foot at some point. Typical scenario. You modify some data thinking that it's your own private copy and it accidentally corrupts some data in some other part of the program.

_Comment: This is one of the reasons why the primitive datatypes (int, float, string) are immutable (read-only)._
