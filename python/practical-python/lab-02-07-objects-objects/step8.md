# Names, Values, Types

Variable names do not have a _type_. It's only a name. However, values _do_ have an underlying type.

```python
>>> a = 42
>>> b = 'Hello World'
>>> type(a)
<type 'int'>
>>> type(b)
<type 'str'>
```

`type()` will tell you what it is. The type name is usually used as a function that creates or converts a value to that type.
