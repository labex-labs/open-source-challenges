# What is a Function?

A function is a named sequence of statements.

```python
def funcname(args):
  statement
  statement
  ...
  return result
```

_Any_ Python statement can be used inside.

```python
def foo():
    import math
    print(math.sqrt(2))
    help(math)
```

There are no _special_ statements in Python (which makes it easy to remember).
