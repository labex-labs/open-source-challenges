# Exercise 3.1: Structuring a program as a collection of functions

Modify your `report.py` program so that all major operations, including calculations and output, are carried out by a collection of functions. Specifically:

- Create a function `print_report(report)` that prints out the report.
- Change the last part of the program so that it is nothing more than a series of function calls and no other computation.
