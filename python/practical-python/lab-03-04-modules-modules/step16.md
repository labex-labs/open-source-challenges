When you are done with this exercise, you should have three programs. `fileparse.py` which contains a general purpose `parse_csv()` function. `report.py` which produces a nice report, but also contains `read_portfolio()` and `read_prices()` functions. And finally, `pcost.py` which computes the portfolio cost, but makes use of the `read_portfolio()` function written for the `report.py` program.
