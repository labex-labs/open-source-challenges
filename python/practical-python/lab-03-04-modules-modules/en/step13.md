# Exercise 3.12: Using your library module

In section 2, you wrote a program `report.py` that produced a stock report like this:

          Name     Shares      Price     Change
    ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
            AA        100       9.22     -22.98
           IBM         50     106.28      15.18
           CAT        150      35.46     -47.98
          MSFT        200      20.89     -30.34
            GE         95      13.48     -26.89
          MSFT         50      20.89     -44.21
           IBM        100     106.28      35.84

Take that program and modify it so that all of the input file processing is done using functions in your `fileparse` module. To do that, import `fileparse` as a module and change the `read_portfolio()` and `read_prices()` functions to use the `parse_csv()` function.

Use the interactive example at the start of this exercise as a guide. Afterwards, you should get exactly the same output as before.
