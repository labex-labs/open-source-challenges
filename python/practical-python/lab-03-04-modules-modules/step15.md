# Exercise 3.14: Using more library imports

In section 1, you wrote a program `pcost.py` that read a portfolio and computed its cost.

```python
>>> import pcost
>>> pcost.portfolio_cost('Data/portfolio.csv')
44671.15
>>>
```

Modify the `pcost.py` file so that it uses the `report.read_portfolio()` function.
