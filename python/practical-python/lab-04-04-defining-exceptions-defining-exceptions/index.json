  "description": "In this lab, we will learn about user-defined exceptions in Python, which are defined by creating classes that inherit from the `Exception` class. These classes usually do not have any additional code, and we use the `pass` statement to indicate that the class body is empty. Furthermore, we can create a hierarchy of exceptions by creating subclasses that inherit from other exception classes, allowing for more specific types of errors to be handled.",
