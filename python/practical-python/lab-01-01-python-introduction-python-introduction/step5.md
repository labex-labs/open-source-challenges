# Exercise 1.2: Getting help

Use the `help()` command to get help on the `abs()` function. Then use `help()` to get help on the `round()` function. Type `help()` just by itself with no value to enter the interactive help viewer.

One caution with `help()` is that it doesn't work for basic Python statements such as `for`, `if`, `while`, and so forth (i.e., if you type `help(for)` you'll get a syntax error). You can try putting the help topic in quotes such as `help("for")` instead. If that doesn't work, you'll have to turn to an internet search.

Followup: Go to <http://docs.python.org> and find the documentation for the `abs()` function (hint: it's found under the library reference related to built-in functions).
