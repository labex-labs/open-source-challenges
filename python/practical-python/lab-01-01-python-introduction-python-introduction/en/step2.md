# Why was Python created?

In the words of Python's creator:

> My original motivation for creating Python was the perceived need for a higher level language in the Amoeba \[Operating Systems\] project. I realized that the development of system administration utilities in C was taking too long. Moreover, doing these things in the Bourne shell wouldn't work for a variety of reasons. ... So, there was a need for a language that would bridge the gap between C and the shell.
