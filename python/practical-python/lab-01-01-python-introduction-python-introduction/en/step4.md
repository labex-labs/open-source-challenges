# Exercise 1.1: Using Python as a Calculator

On your machine, start Python and use it as a calculator to solve the following problem.

Lucky Larry bought 75 shares of Google stock at a price of \$235.14 per share. Today, shares of Google are priced at \$711.25. Using Python's interactive mode as a calculator, figure out how much profit Larry would make if he sold all of his shares.

```python
>>> (711.25 - 235.14) * 75
35708.25
>>>
```

Pro-tip: Use the underscore (\_) variable to use the result of the last calculation. For example, how much profit does Larry make after his evil broker takes their 20% cut?

```python
>>> _ * 0.80
28566.600000000002
>>>
```
