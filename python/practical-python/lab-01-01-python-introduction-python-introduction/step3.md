# Where is Python on my Machine?

Although there are many environments in which you might run Python, Python is typically installed on your machine as a program that runs from the terminal or command shell. From the terminal, you should be able to type `python` like this:

    $ python
    Python 3.8.1 (default, Feb 20 2020, 09:29:22)
    [Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.10.44.4)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> print("hello world")
    hello world
    >>>

If you are new to using the shell or a terminal, you should probably stop, finish a short tutorial on that first, and then return here.

Although there are many non-shell environments where you can code Python, you will be a stronger Python programmer if you are able to run, debug, and interact with Python at the terminal. This is Python's native environment. If you are able to use Python here, you will be able to use it everywhere else.
