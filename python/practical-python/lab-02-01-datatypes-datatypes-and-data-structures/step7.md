# Tuples vs.Â Lists

Tuples look like read-only lists. However, tuples are most often used for a _single item_ consisting of multiple parts. Lists are usually a collection of distinct items, usually all of the same type.

```python
record = ('GOOG', 100, 490.1)       # A tuple representing a record in a portfolio

symbols = [ 'GOOG', 'AAPL', 'IBM' ]  # A List representing three stock symbols
```
