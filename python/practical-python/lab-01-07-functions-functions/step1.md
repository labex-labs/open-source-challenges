# Custom Functions

Use functions for code you want to reuse. Here is a function definition:

```python
def sumcount(n):
    '''
    Returns the sum of the first n integers
    '''
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n
        n -= 1
    return total
```

To call a function.

```python
a = sumcount(100)
```

A function is a series of statements that perform some task and return a result. The `return` keyword is needed to explicitly specify the return value of the function.
