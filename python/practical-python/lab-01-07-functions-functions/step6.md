# Exercise 1.29: Defining a function

Try defining a simple function:

```python
>>> def greeting(name):
        'Issues a greeting'
        print('Hello', name)

>>> greeting('Guido')
Hello Guido
>>> greeting('Paula')
Hello Paula
>>>
```

If the first statement of a function is a string, it serves as documentation. Try typing a command such as `help(greeting)` to see it displayed.
