# Decorator Syntax

The `@` syntax is known as "decoration". It specifies a modifier that's applied to the function definition that immediately follows.

```python
...
@property
def cost(self):
    return self.shares * self.price
```

More details are given in [Section 7](../07_Advanced_Topics/00_Overview).
