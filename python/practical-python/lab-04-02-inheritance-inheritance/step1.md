# Introduction

Inheritance is used to specialize existing objects:

```python
class Parent:
    ...

class Child(Parent):
    ...
```

The new class `Child` is called a derived class or subclass. The `Parent` class is known as base class or superclass. `Parent` is specified in `()` after the class name, `class Child(Parent):`.
