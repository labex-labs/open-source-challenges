Writing extensible code is one of the most common uses of inheritance in libraries and frameworks. For example, a framework might instruct you to define your own object that inherits from a provided base class. You're then told to fill in various methods that implement various bits of functionality.

Another somewhat deeper concept is the idea of "owning your abstractions." In the exercises, we defined _our own class_ for formatting a table. You may look at your code and tell yourself "I should just use a formatting library or something that someone else already made instead!" No, you should use BOTH your class and a library. Using your own class promotes loose coupling and is more flexible. As long as your application uses the programming interface of your class, you can change the internal implementation to work in any way that you want. You can write all-custom code. You can use someone's third party package. You swap out one third-party package for a different package when you find a better one. It doesn't matter--none of your application code will break as long as you preserve the interface. That's a powerful idea and it's one of the reasons why you might consider inheritance for something like this.

That said, designing object oriented programs can be extremely difficult. For more information, you should probably look for books on the topic of design patterns (although understanding what happened in this exercise will take you pretty far in terms of using objects in a practically useful way).
