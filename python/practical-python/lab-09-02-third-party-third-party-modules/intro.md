# Introduction

Python has a large library of built-in modules (_batteries included_).

There are even more third party modules. Check them in the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) or PyPi.
Or just do a Google search for a specific topic.

How to handle third-party dependencies is an ever-evolving topic with
Python. This section merely covers the basics to help you wrap
your brain around how it works.
