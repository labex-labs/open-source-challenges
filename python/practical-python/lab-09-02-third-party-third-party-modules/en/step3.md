# Third-party Modules

Third party modules are usually located in a dedicated `site-packages` directory. You'll see it if you perform the same steps as above:

```python
>>> import numpy
>>> numpy
<module 'numpy' from '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py'>
>>>
```

Again, looking at a module is a good debugging tip if you're trying to figure out why something related to `import` isn't working as expected.
