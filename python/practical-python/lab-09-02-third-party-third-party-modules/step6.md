# Virtual Environments

A common solution to package installation issues is to create a so-called "virtual environment" for yourself. Naturally, there is no "one way" to do this--in fact, there are several competing tools and techniques. However, if you are using a standard Python installation, you can try typing this:

```bash
$ python -m venv mypython
bash %
```

After a few moments of waiting, you will have a new directory `mypython` that's your own little Python install. Within that directory you'll find a `bin/` directory (Unix) or a `Scripts/` directory (Windows). If you run the `activate` script found there, it will "activate" this version of Python, making it the default `python` command for the shell. For example:

```bash
$ source mypython/bin/activate
(mypython) bash %
```

From here, you can now start installing Python packages for yourself. For example:

    (mypython) $ python -m pip install pandas
    ...

For the purposes of experimenting and trying out different packages, a virtual environment will usually work fine. If, on the other hand, you're creating an application and it has specific package dependencies, that is a slightly different problem.
