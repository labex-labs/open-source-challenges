# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the world of CSS animations by creating a bouncing loader animation. This lab is designed to help you understand how to use `@keyframes` to define animations, how to apply animations to elements using CSS, and how to control the timing and direction of animations. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create engaging and dynamic animations using CSS.
