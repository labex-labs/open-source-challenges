# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of perspective transforms and hover animations in CSS. We will create a visually appealing card container by using the `perspective()` and `rotateY()` functions to apply a perspective transform to the card elements. Additionally, we will add a hover animation to the card elements using the `transition` property to dynamically update the transform value upon hover. This lab will provide a hands-on experience in creating engaging and interactive user interfaces using CSS.
