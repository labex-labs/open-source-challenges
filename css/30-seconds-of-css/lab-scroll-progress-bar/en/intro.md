# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a scroll progress bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The scroll progress bar is a great way to indicate the user's current position on the page and how much more content is left to be seen. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to implement this feature on your website.
