# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a scroll progress bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This progress bar will indicate the percentage of the page that has been scrolled by the user. By using `position: fixed` and a large `z-index` value, we can place the progress bar at the top of the page and above any content.
