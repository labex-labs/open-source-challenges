In this lab, we will explore the technique of creating an "etched" or engraved text effect using CSS. This effect gives the appearance of text being carved out of the background, adding depth and dimension to the design. By adjusting the text color and shadow, we can achieve a subtle yet impactful effect that enhances the overall look and feel of the webpage.
