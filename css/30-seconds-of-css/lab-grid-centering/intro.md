# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of grid centering using CSS. You will learn how to horizontally and vertically center a child element within a parent element using the `grid` layout. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use `justify-content` and `align-items` properties to create a perfectly centered layout.
