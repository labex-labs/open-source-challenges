# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a technique to create a pretty text underline that does not clip descenders. By using a combination of `text-shadow` and `background-image` with `linear-gradient()`, we can create an attractive and functional underline for our text. This lab will guide you through the necessary CSS code to implement this technique in your projects.
