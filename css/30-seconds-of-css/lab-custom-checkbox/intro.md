# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use CSS to create custom checkboxes with animation on state change. We will use an SVG element to create the check symbol, flexbox to layout the checkboxes, and CSS animations to create a zoom effect. By the end of this lab, you will have the skills to create stylish and interactive checkboxes for your web projects.
