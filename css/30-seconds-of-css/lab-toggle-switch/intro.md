# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a toggle switch using CSS only. We will use the `for` attribute to associate the `<label>` with the checkbox `<input>` element and the `::after` pseudo-element of the `<label>` to create a circular knob for the switch. We will also use the `:checked` pseudo-class selector to change the position of the knob and the `background-color` of the switch.
