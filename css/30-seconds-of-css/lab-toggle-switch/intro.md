# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a toggle switch using only CSS. The purpose of this lab is to teach you how to use the `:checked` pseudo-class selector, `::after` pseudo-element, and position properties to create an interactive and visually appealing toggle switch. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use CSS to add interactivity to your web pages.
