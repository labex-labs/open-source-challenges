# Introduction

In this lab, we will be learning about image text overlays using CSS. The purpose of this lab is to teach you how to display text on top of an image with an overlay, making it readable regardless of the background image and color. You will learn how to use the `backdrop-filter` property to apply a `blur` and `brightness` effect to your text, creating a professional and visually appealing design.
