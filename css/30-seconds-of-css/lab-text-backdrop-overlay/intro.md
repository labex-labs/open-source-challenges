# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the technique of displaying text on top of an image using an overlay. We will use CSS `backdrop-filter` to apply a blur and brightness effect to the background image, making the text readable regardless of the image and color. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create stunning image text overlays on your website.
