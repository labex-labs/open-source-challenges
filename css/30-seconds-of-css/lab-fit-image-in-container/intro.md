# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use CSS to fit and position images within their containers while preserving their aspect ratio. We will explore the `object-fit` and `object-position` properties and how they can be used to achieve different results. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create visually appealing images that fit perfectly within their designated space.
