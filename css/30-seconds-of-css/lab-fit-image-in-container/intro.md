# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concepts of fitting images in containers using CSS. The lab aims to teach you how to use the `object-fit` and `object-position` properties to manipulate the appearance of images and ensure they fit within their containers while preserving their aspect ratios. By the end of this lab, you will have the skills to create visually appealing and responsive image layouts for your web pages.
