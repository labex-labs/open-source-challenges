# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use CSS clearfix technique to ensure that an element self-clears its children. We will use the `::after` pseudo-element and the `clear: both` property to clear past both left and right floats. This lab will provide a practical understanding of how to build layouts using `float` and how to modernize them with the flexbox or grid layout.
