# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of Box-Sizing Reset in CSS programming. The lab will cover how to reset the box-model and prevent the `width` and `height` of an element from being affected by `border` or `padding`. By the end of the lab, you will have a thorough understanding of the `box-sizing` property and how it can be used to enhance the design of your web pages.
