# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `:empty` pseudo-class in CSS, which allows us to select and hide elements that have no content. By applying this technique, we can improve the overall design and readability of our web pages by removing clutter and empty spaces. Through a series of exercises, we will learn how to effectively use the `:empty` pseudo-class to hide empty elements and create cleaner and more polished web pages.
