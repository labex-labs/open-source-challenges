# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of system font stacks in CSS. You will learn how to define a list of fonts that the browser will look for on the user's operating system, and how to use this technique to achieve a native app feel on your web pages. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement system font stacks in your own projects.
