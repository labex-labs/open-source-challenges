# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to center a child element within its parent element using CSS transforms. We will use the `position`, `left`, `top`, and `transform` properties to achieve vertical and horizontal centering. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use CSS to center content on a web page.
