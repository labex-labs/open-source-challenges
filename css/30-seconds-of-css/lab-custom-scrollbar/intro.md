# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to customize the appearance of the scrollbar using CSS. We will use the `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-element to style the scrollbar, including the track and thumb. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create custom scrollbars that match the design of your website or application.
