# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of resetting all styles to their default values using the `all` property in CSS. This technique can be used to quickly remove all inherited or custom styles from an element and start fresh. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use the `all` property and its limitations.
