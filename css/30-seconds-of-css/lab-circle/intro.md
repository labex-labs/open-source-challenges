# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore CSS programming by practicing different techniques to style HTML elements. Through hands-on exercises, we will learn how to use selectors, properties, and values to create visually appealing web pages. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of CSS and be able to apply it to your own web development projects.
