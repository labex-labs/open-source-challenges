# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of aspect ratios in CSS and how to create responsive containers with a specified aspect ratio. By using CSS custom properties and the `calc()` function, we will calculate the height of the container based on the desired aspect ratio and set the child element to maintain the aspect ratio using `object-fit: cover`. This lab will equip you with the skills to create visually appealing and responsive layouts for your web projects.
