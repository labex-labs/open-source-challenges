# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use CSS to create a sibling fade effect. This effect fades out the siblings of a hovered item and uses the `:hover` and `:not` pseudo-class selectors to change the opacity of all elements except for the one the mouse is over. We will also use the `transition` property to animate changes to opacity.
