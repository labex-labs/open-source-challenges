# Introduction

In this lab, we will work on a CSS programming project to create a horizontally scrollable image gallery with a snap effect. We will use various CSS properties and JavaScript methods to achieve this functionality, including `scroll-snap-type`, `overscroll-behavior-x`, `scroll-snap-align`, and `Element.scrollTo()`. Through this lab, you will learn how to create a dynamic image gallery that enhances user experience and engagement.
