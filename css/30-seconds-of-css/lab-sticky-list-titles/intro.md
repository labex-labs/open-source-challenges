# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the world of CSS and learn how to create a list with sticky section headings. By using `position: sticky` and `overflow-y: auto`, we will create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through different sections of the list. This lab will provide hands-on experience in using CSS properties to enhance the functionality and aesthetics of a web page.
