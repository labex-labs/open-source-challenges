# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to handle the issue of images that fail to load on a webpage. We will use CSS to apply styles to the `img` element and display an error message and the image URL using the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. This will improve the user experience by providing feedback when an image is unavailable.
