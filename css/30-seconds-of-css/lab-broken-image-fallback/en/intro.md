# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to apply styles to the `img` element to display an error message and the image URL when an image fails to load. We will use the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to create a user-friendly fallback for images that cannot be displayed. By the end of this lab, you will be able to enhance user experience by providing helpful information in case of image loading failures.
