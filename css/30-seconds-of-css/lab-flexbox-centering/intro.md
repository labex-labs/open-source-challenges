# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of flexbox centering and learn how to horizontally and vertically center a child element within a parent element using flexbox. You will get hands-on experience by practicing with sample code and gain a better understanding of how to use `display: flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` properties to center content. By the end of this lab, you will be able to apply flexbox centering to your own projects and create visually appealing designs.
