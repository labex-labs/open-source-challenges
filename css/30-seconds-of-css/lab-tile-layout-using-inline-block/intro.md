# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a 3-tile layout using CSS. We will use the `display: inline-block` property to align the items horizontally and evenly divide the container's width into three columns using `width` and `calc`. Additionally, we will set the `font-size` to avoid whitespace and display the text correctly. By the end of this lab, you will have a clear understanding of how to create a simple and elegant tiled layout without using `float`, `flex` or `grid`.
