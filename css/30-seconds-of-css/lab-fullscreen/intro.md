# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `:fullscreen` CSS pseudo-element selector to apply styles to an element when it is in fullscreen mode. We will also create a button using `Element.requestFullscreen()` to make the element fullscreen for previewing the style. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement fullscreen mode on elements and apply custom styles to them.
