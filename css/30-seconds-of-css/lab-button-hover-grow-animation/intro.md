# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a button grow animation on hover using CSS. The purpose of this lab is to teach you how to use the `:hover` pseudo-class and the `transition` property to create a smooth and visually appealing animation effect on buttons. By the end of this lab, you will be able to apply this animation technique to other elements in your web design projects.
