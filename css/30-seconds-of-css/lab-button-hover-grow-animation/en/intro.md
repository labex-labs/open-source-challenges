# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a button with a grow animation on hover using CSS. This effect can be used to add interactivity and visual interest to a website or application. By applying the `transform` property and `:hover` pseudo-class, we can make the button scale up when the user hovers over it, creating a subtle but effective animation.
