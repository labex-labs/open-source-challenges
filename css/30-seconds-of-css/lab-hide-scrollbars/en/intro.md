# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of hiding scrollbars on an element while still allowing it to be scrollable using CSS. We will use the `overflow: auto` property to enable scrolling, and `scrollbar-width: none` to hide scrollbars on Firefox, and `display: none` on the `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-element to hide scrollbars on WebKit browsers. This lab will provide a hands-on experience in implementing this CSS technique to improve user experience on scrollable elements.
