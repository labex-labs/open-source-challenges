# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of hiding scrollbars on elements using CSS. We will learn how to use the `overflow` property to enable scrolling, and the `scrollbar-width` property to hide scrollbars on Firefox. Additionally, we will use the `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-element with `display: none` to hide scrollbars on WebKit browsers. This lab will equip you with a useful skill for designing sleek and modern-looking web interfaces.
