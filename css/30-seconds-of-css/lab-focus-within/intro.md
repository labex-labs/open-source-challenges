# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the CSS pseudo-class `:focus-within` to change the appearance of a form when any of its children elements receive focus. This will help us create more interactive and user-friendly forms that provide visual feedback to the user when they are interacting with it. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use this pseudo-class to enhance the user experience of your web forms.
