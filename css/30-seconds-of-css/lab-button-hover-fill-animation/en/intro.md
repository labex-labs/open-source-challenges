# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a fill animation on hover for a button using CSS. We will use the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the `background` and `color` of the button when the user hovers over it, and also add a transition effect to animate the changes. By the end of this lab, you will be able to enhance the user experience on your website by adding engaging hover effects to your buttons.
