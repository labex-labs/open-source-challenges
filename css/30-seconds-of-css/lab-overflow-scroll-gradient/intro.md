# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the technique of adding a fading gradient to an overflowing element using CSS. This technique is used to better indicate to users that there is more content available to be scrolled. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement the overflow scroll gradient effect in your own web projects.
