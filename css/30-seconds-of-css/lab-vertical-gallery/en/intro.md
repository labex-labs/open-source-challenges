# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the basics of CSS programming by creating a simple image gallery with a vertical scroll. You will learn how to use flexbox and scroll-snap properties to create a smooth scroll effect, hide scrollbars, and style the scrollbar thumb. By the end of this lab, you will have gained a better understanding of how to use CSS to create responsive and interactive web designs.
