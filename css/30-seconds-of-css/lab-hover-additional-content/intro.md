# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a card that displays additional content on hover. We will use CSS to hide elements that overflow vertically, and the `:hover` and `:focus-within` pseudo-class selectors to change the card's styling on hover or focus. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to create a hover effect that displays additional content, providing a more interactive user experience for your website visitors.
