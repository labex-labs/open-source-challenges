# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the use of CSS selectors and pseudo-elements to display link URLs for links with no text. You will learn how to use the `:empty` and `:not` pseudo-classes to select and exclude links with text, and how to use the `content` property and `attr()` function to display the link URL in the `::before` pseudo-element. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to style links and improve the user experience on your website.
