# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore CSS programming and learn how to style links with no text. Specifically, we will use the `:empty` and `:not` pseudo-classes, as well as the `content` property and `attr()` function, to display the link URL in the `::before` pseudo-element. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate the appearance of links in your web pages.
