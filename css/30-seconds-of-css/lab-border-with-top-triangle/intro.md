# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a border with a top triangle using CSS. This lab will help you learn how to use the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to create triangles and position them to form a container with a unique design. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of CSS positioning and be able to create more complex designs for your web pages.
