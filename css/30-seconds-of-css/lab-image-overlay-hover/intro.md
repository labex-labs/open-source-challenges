# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a visually appealing image overlay effect on hover using HTML and CSS. By using pseudo-elements, transitions, and the `:hover` selector, we will be able to add an overlay with text that appears when a user hovers over an image. This lab is perfect for those who want to enhance their web design skills and create more engaging user experiences on their websites.
