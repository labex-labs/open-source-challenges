# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of truncating text using CSS. You will learn how to use the `overflow`, `white-space`, and `text-overflow` properties to create a single line of text that ends with an ellipsis if it exceeds a specified width. By the end of this lab, you will be able to apply this technique to your own projects to ensure that text fits neatly within its container.
