# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the world of CSS programming and learn how to truncate text that exceeds one line's width. By using the combination of `overflow`, `white-space`, and `text-overflow` properties, we will be able to display an ellipsis at the end of the truncated text. Through this lab, we will gain a deeper understanding of how to optimize the display of text on websites.
