# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a pulse effect loader animation using CSS. We will use the `animation-delay` property to create a rhythmic effect and `@keyframes` to define the animation at two points in the cycle. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to create engaging animations that can enhance the user experience of your web pages.
