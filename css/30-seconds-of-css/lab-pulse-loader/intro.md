# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a pulse effect loader animation using CSS. By using the `animation-delay` property and `@keyframes` rule, we can create a visually appealing and dynamic loading animation for our web pages. Through this lab, we will gain a better understanding of CSS animations and how to implement them in our projects.
