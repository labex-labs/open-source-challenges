# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the use of counters in CSS to create custom list counters that account for nested list elements. We will learn how to initialize and increment variables using `counter-reset` and `counter-increment` properties, and how to display the value of each variable using `counters()` function in the `::before` pseudo-element. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to create and customize list counters in CSS.
