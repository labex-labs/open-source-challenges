# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the use of CSS counters to create custom list counters. Specifically, we will learn how to initialize and increment counter variables, and how to display the value of these variables using the `counters()` function. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create nested list counters and customize the appearance of list elements using CSS.
