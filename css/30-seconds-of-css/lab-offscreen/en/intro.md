# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of hiding elements offscreen in CSS. This technique allows us to make elements inaccessible visually and positionally while still allowing them to be accessible to assistive technologies. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use this technique to create more accessible and layout-friendly web pages.
