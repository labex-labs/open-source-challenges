# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore CSS programming by creating a mouse cursor gradient tracking effect on a button. This lab will teach you how to use CSS variables to track the position of the mouse cursor and update the dimensions of a gradient. You will also learn how to use JavaScript to handle mouse events and update CSS variables dynamically.
