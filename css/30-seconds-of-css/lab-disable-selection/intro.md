# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into CSS programming and explore the `user-select` property. This lab aims to teach you how to disable selection of certain elements in your web page, which can be useful in preventing users from copying content. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use the `user-select` property and its impact on web design.
