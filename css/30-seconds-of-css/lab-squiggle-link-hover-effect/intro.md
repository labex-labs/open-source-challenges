# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a Squiggle Link Hover Effect using CSS. This effect creates a squiggly animation when hovering over a link, adding a fun and dynamic element to your website. By using a linear-gradient background and an SVG with a squiggly path, we can achieve this effect with just a few lines of code.
