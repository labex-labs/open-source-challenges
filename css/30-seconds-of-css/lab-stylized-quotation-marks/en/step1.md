# Stylized Quotation Marks

`index.html` and `style.css` have already been provided in the VM.

To customize the inline quotation marks, modify the `quotes` property within a `<q>` element.

For example:

```html
<p><q>Do or do not, there is no try.</q> – Yoda</p>
```

can be styled with curly quotes using CSS:

```css
q {
  quotes: "“" "”";
}
```
