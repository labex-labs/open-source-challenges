# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `quotes` property in CSS, which allows us to customize the quotation marks used for inline quotes. We will learn how to use this property to define our own opening and closing quote characters, and apply them to `<q>` elements in our HTML. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to add a personal touch to the styling of your web pages.
