# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `quotes` property in CSS and learn how to customize the style of inline quotation marks. We will use the `<q>` element to add quotes to our text and then apply different characters for the opening and closing quotes using the `quotes` property. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use this property to add a personal touch to your web pages.
