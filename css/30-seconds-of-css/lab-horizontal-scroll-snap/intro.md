# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of Horizontal Scroll Snap in CSS. You will learn how to create a horizontally scrollable container that snaps on elements when scrolling, using `display: grid`, `scroll-snap-type`, and `overscroll-behavior-x`. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create engaging and interactive user interfaces with a snap effect on horizontal scroll.
