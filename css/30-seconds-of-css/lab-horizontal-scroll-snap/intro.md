# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of horizontal scroll snap in CSS. The lab will guide you through creating a horizontally scrollable container that will snap on elements when scrolling. You will learn how to use the `scroll-snap-type` property and `scroll-snap-align` to create a snap effect and how to control the alignment of the snap. By the end of the lab, you will have a good understanding of how to create a sleek and user-friendly horizontal scrolling layout.
