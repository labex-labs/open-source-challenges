# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a shake animation on invalid input using CSS. The purpose of this lab is to help you enhance the user experience of your web forms by providing visual feedback when the user enters invalid input. By the end of this lab, you will be able to use keyframes and the `:invalid` pseudo-class to create a shake animation that alerts users to errors in their input.
