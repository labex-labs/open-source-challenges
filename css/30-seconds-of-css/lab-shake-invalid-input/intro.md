# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore CSS animations and pseudo-classes to create an input validation effect. Specifically, we will create a shake animation on invalid input using keyframes and the `:invalid` pseudo-class. This lab will help you improve your CSS skills and learn how to add dynamic and engaging effects to your web pages.
