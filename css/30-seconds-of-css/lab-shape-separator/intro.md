# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to create a shape separator using CSS. The separator will use an SVG shape to visually divide two different blocks. By using the `::after` pseudo-element and setting the parent element's background color, we can easily customize the separator to match the overall design of our webpage. This lab will provide hands-on experience in creating a visually appealing and functional separator using CSS.
