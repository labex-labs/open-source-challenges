# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a separator between two blocks using an SVG shape in CSS. We will use the `::after` pseudo-element to create the separator and set its background image to an SVG shape. We will also learn how to set the color of the separator using the `background` property of the parent element. This lab will help you add visual interest to your web designs by creating a stylish separator.
