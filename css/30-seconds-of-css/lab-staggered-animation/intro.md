# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a staggered animation effect for a list of elements using CSS. By setting opacity and transform properties and using inline styles for transition-delay, we can create a visually appealing animation that brings list elements into view one after another. This lab will help you enhance your CSS skills and create engaging user interfaces.
