# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a staggered animation effect for a list of elements using CSS. We will use the `opacity` and `transform` properties to make the elements transparent and move them all the way to the right. Then, we will use `transition-delay` and the `:checked` pseudo-class selector to make the elements appear and slide into view in a staggered manner. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create visually appealing animations for your web pages.
