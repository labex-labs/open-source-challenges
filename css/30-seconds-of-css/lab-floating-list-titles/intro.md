# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a list with floating section headings using CSS. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to use the `position: sticky` property and `display: grid` to create a layout with two columns. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a floating effect on headings and organize your content into sections with ease.
