In this lab, we will be exploring the world of CSS programming. The main objective of this lab is to provide hands-on experience with creating a responsive layout with a sidebar. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use `display: grid` and `minmax()` properties to create an effective and visually appealing layout.
