# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to smoothly transition an element's height from `0` to `auto` when its height is unknown. This technique is useful for creating dropdown menus, accordions, and other animated content. By using CSS `transition`, `max-height`, and `overflow` properties, as well as JavaScript to dynamically set the height value, we can create a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
