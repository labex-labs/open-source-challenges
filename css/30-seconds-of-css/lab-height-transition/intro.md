# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a smooth height transition for an element with unknown height using CSS. We will use the `max-height` property and `transition` property to create the animation, and `overflow: hidden` to prevent content overflow. Additionally, we will utilize JavaScript to dynamically set the `max-height` property to the element's current height. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create elegant height transitions for any element with unknown height.
