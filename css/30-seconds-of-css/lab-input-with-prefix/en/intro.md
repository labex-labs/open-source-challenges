# Introduction

In this lab, we will be creating an input box with a visual, non-editable prefix. By using CSS and HTML, we will create a container element with a prefix and an input field. We will also use the `:focus-within` pseudo-class selector to style the parent element accordingly, providing a better user experience when interacting with the input field.
