# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an input field with a visual, non-editable prefix using HTML and CSS. The prefix can be used to display a label or a symbol before the input field, such as a currency symbol or a country code. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create stylish and user-friendly input fields for your web projects.
