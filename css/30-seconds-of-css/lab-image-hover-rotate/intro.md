# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a simple but effective image rotate effect on hover using CSS. This effect can be useful for adding a touch of interactivity to your website or application, and can make your images stand out. By using the `scale()`, `rotate()`, and `transition` properties, we can create a smooth and visually appealing animation that is sure to impress.
