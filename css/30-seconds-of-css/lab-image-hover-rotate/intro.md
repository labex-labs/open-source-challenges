# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a hover effect that rotates an image using CSS properties. By using `scale()`, `rotate()`, and `transition`, we can make the image appear to rotate when the user hovers over the parent element. We will also use `overflow: hidden` to hide the excess from the image transformation, creating a clean and polished effect.
