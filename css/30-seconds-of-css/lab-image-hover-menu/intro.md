# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a menu overlay that appears when a user hovers over an image. By using HTML and CSS, we will create an animation that slides the image and reveals a menu containing links. This technique can be used to add interactivity and engagement to websites and can be customized to fit any design.
