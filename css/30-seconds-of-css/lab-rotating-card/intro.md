# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of creating a rotating card using CSS. We will learn how to create a two-sided card that rotates smoothly on hover, using the `transform` property and the `perspective` value to create a 3D effect. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to create interactive and engaging UI elements using CSS.
