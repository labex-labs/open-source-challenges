# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a button border animation using CSS. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to use pseudo-elements and the `:hover` pseudo-class to create a simple yet effective animation that enhances the user experience. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of CSS animation techniques and how to apply them to your own projects.
