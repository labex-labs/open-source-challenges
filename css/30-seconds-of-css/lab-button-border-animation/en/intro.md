# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a button border animation on hover using CSS. By using the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, we can add two boxes above and below the button and transition their width to `100%` on hover. This lab will help you to enhance your CSS skills and add interactivity to your web pages.
