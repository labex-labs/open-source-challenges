# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a zig zag background pattern using CSS. This lab aims to help you understand how to use `background-image`, `background-size`, and `background-position` to create a visually appealing pattern. By the end of this lab, you will be able to apply this knowledge to create other background patterns as well.
