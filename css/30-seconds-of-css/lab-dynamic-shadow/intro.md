# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the world of CSS programming and learn how to create a dynamic shadow effect for HTML elements. We will use the `::after` pseudo-element along with various CSS properties such as `background`, `filter`, and `opacity` to achieve the desired effect. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create visually appealing designs using CSS.
