# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of creating a masonry-style layout using CSS. The purpose of this lab is to provide you with the skills and knowledge needed to design a layout that consists of "bricks" that fall into each other with a fixed width or height, forming a perfect fit. This is especially useful when working with images, and we will be using CSS variables and media queries for greater flexibility and responsiveness.
