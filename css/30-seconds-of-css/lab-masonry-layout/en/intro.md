# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of masonry layout and learn how to create a visually appealing grid-like structure that is perfect for displaying images. By using CSS and HTML, we will build a responsive masonry-style layout with flexible column counts and column widths that adapts to various screen sizes. This lab will provide hands-on experience in creating an elegant and functional layout for your web pages.
