# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to create arrays using NumPy, a fundamental library for array containers in Python. You will learn different methods for array creation, including converting Python sequences, using intrinsic NumPy array creation functions, replicating and joining existing arrays, reading arrays from disk, creating arrays from raw bytes, and using special library functions.

> Note: You can write code in `01-array-creation.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
