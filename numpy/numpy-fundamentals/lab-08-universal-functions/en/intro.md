# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the basics of NumPy Universal Functions (ufuncs). Ufuncs are functions that operate on ndarrays in an element-by-element fashion, supporting array broadcasting, type casting, and other standard features. We will learn about the different methods of ufuncs, broadcasting rules, type casting rules, and how to override ufunc behavior.

> Note: You can write code in `08-universal-functions.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
