# Introduction

This lab will provide a step-by-step guide to understanding the different data types available in NumPy, and how to modify an array's data type. NumPy supports a wide range of numerical types, including booleans, integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. Understanding these data types is important for performing various numerical computations and data analysis tasks using NumPy.

> Note: You can write code in `04-data-types.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
