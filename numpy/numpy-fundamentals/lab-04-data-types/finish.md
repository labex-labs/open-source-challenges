# Summary

In this lab, you learned about the different numerical data types available in NumPy and how to work with them. You can use `dtype` objects to convert Python numbers to array scalars, create arrays of specific types, and modify the data type of an array. Understanding data types is important for performing numerical computations and data analysis tasks using NumPy.
