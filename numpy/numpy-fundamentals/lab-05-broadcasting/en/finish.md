# Summary

In this lab, we learned about broadcasting in NumPy. Broadcasting allows for element-wise operations on arrays with different shapes, making it a powerful tool for vectorizing array operations and improving computational efficiency. By understanding the broadcasting rules and using it appropriately, you can simplify and optimize your code.
