# Introduction

Broadcasting is a powerful feature in NumPy that allows arrays with different shapes to be used in arithmetic operations. It provides a way to vectorize array operations and improve computational efficiency. This lab will guide you through the basics of broadcasting in NumPy.

> Note: You can write code in `05-broadcasting.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
