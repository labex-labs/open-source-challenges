# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create and work with structured arrays in NumPy. Structured arrays are useful for working with structured data, and they allow us to access and modify individual fields of the array. We also learned about record arrays, which provide a more convenient way to work with structured data by allowing access to fields by attribute instead of index.
