# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about structured arrays in NumPy. Structured arrays are ndarrays whose datatype is a composition of simpler datatypes organized as a sequence of named fields. They are useful for working with structured data, such as tabular data, where each field represents a different attribute of the data.

> Note: You can write code in `07-structured-arrays.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
