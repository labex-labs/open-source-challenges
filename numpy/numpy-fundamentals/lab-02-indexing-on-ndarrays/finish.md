# Summary

In this lab, we explored the basics of indexing in NumPy. We learned how to use basic indexing, slicing, advanced indexing, field access, flat iterator indexing, and assigning values to indexed arrays. Understanding these indexing techniques is essential for working with arrays effectively in NumPy.
