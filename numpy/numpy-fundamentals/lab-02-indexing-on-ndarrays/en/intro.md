# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the basics of indexing in NumPy. Indexing allows us to access and manipulate specific elements or subsets of elements in an array. Understanding how to use indexing effectively is crucial for working with arrays in NumPy.

> Note: You can write code in `02-indexing-on-ndarrays.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
