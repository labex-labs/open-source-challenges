# Summary

In this lab, you learned the basics of working with NumPy arrays. You learned about copies and views, and how to create them. You also learned about indexing operations and other operations that can create views or copies. Finally, you learned how to determine if an array is a view or a copy using the `base` attribute.

By understanding these concepts and using the appropriate methods, you can efficiently manipulate and analyze data using NumPy.
