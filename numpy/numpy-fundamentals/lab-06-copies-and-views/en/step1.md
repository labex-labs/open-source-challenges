# Understanding Copies and Views

NumPy arrays consist of two parts: the data buffer and the metadata. The data buffer contains the actual data elements, while the metadata includes information such as data type and strides.

When operating on NumPy arrays, it is important to understand the difference between copies and views:

- A **view** allows you to access the array differently by changing certain metadata without changing the data buffer. Any changes made to a view will be reflected in the original array.

- A **copy** is a new array that duplicates both the data buffer and the metadata. Changes made to a copy will not affect the original array.
