# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn the basics of working with NumPy arrays. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides efficient data structures and functions for performing mathematical operations on arrays.

> Note: You can write code in `06-copies-and-views.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
