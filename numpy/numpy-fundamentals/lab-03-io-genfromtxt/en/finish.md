# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to import data using the `numpy.genfromtxt` function. We explored different options for defining the input, splitting the lines into columns, choosing columns, setting the data type, and tweaking the conversion. We also learned about shortcut functions provided by the `numpy.lib.npyio` module.
