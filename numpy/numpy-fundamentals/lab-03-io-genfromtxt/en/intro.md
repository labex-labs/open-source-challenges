# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to import data using the `numpy.genfromtxt` function. This function allows us to read tabular data from various sources and convert it into NumPy arrays. We will explore different options for defining the input, splitting the lines into columns, choosing columns, setting the data type, and tweaking the conversion.

> Note: You can write code in `03-io-genfromtxt.ipynb`. Some printing operations are omitted in the steps, and you can print output as needed.
