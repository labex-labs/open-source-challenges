# Introduction

In Shell programming, the ability to pass arguments to a script is a fundamental and powerful feature. It allows scripts to be more flexible and reusable by accepting input from the command line. This lab will guide you through the process of creating a Shell script that can accept and use command-line arguments. You will learn how to access these arguments within your script, handle multiple arguments, and use special variables to process them efficiently.
