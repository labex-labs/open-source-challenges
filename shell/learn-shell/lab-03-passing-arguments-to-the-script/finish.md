In this lab, you have learned how to create a Shell script that can accept and process command-line arguments. You've explored several key concepts:

1. Creating and making a script executable
2. Accessing individual arguments using special variables ($1, $2, etc.)
3. Using the $# variable to determine the number of arguments
4. Implementing conditional logic to handle different numbers of arguments
5. Using the $@ variable to loop through all provided arguments

These skills are fundamental in Shell scripting and will allow you to create more flexible and powerful scripts that can adapt to different inputs. As you continue to develop your Shell scripting skills, you'll find that the ability to handle command-line arguments is crucial for creating versatile and reusable scripts for various tasks in
