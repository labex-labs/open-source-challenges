# Test the final script

Let's test our final script with multiple arguments:

```bash
./arguments.sh apple banana cherry date
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
Total number of arguments: 4
All arguments:
Argument 1: apple
Argument 2: banana
Argument 3: cherry
Argument 4: date
```

This demonstrates that our script can now handle any number of arguments and display them all.

For beginners:

- This final version of the script is much more flexible than our earlier versions.
- It can handle any number of arguments, from zero to many.
- The script now numbers each argument, which can be very useful in more complex scripts.
- Try running the script with different numbers of arguments to see how it behaves.
