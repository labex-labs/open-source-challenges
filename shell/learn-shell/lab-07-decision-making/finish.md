# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use conditional statements in shell programming. You have practiced using if-else statements, elif clauses, numeric comparisons, string comparisons, and logical operators. These tools allow you to create more complex and decision-based shell scripts.

Key takeaways:

- The basic structure of if-else statements in shell scripts
- How to use elif for multiple conditions
- Numeric comparison operators (-lt, -gt, -eq, etc.)
- String comparison and logical operators
- The importance of making scripts executable with chmod

Remember, practice is key to becoming proficient in shell scripting. Try creating your own scripts that use these concepts in different ways. As you advance, you'll find these conditional statements essential for creating more sophisticated and useful scripts.
