# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to work with arrays in shell programming. Arrays are data structures that allow you to store multiple values under a single name, making it easier to organize and manipulate data. You will learn how to initialize arrays, add elements to them, access elements by their index, and determine the number of elements in an array. This knowledge is fundamental for more advanced shell scripting and data manipulation tasks.
