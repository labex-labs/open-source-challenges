# Print the arrays and variables

Finally, let's print the arrays and variables to verify if everything is working correctly. Add the following code:

```shell
echo "NUMBERS array: ${NUMBERS[@]}"
echo "STRINGS array: ${STRINGS[@]}"
echo "The number of names listed in the NAMES array: $NumberOfNames"
echo "The second name on the NAMES list is: $second_name"
```
