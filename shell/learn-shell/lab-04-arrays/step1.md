# Create a new shell script file

Let's start by creating a new shell script file where we'll write our array operations.

1. Open your terminal in the WebIDE.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/project
   ```

3. Create a new file named `arrays.sh` using the touch command:

   ```bash
   touch arrays.sh
   ```

4. Open the `arrays.sh` file in the WebIDE.
