# Create a Bash Script

Let's start by creating a new Bash script file where we'll implement the `trap` command.

1. Open a terminal in the WebIDE. You should see a prompt ending with a `$` symbol.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/project
   ```

   This command changes your current working directory to `/home/labex/project`.

3. Create a new file named `trap_example.sh`:

   ```bash
   touch trap_example.sh
   ```

   The `touch` command creates an empty file if it doesn't exist, or updates the modification time if it does.

4. Open the `trap_example.sh` file in the WebIDE editor. You can do this by clicking on the file name in the file explorer on the left side of the WebIDE.
