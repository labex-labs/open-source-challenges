# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the `trap` command in Bash scripting. You created a script that catches specific signals and defines actions to be taken when those signals are received. You explored different ways of using the `trap` command, including using inline commands and functions.

The `trap` command is a powerful tool for handling interruptions and performing cleanup actions in your Bash scripts. It allows you to create more robust and user-friendly command-line applications by gracefully handling unexpected terminations and user interrupts.

Remember, the ability to handle signals can be crucial in many scripting scenarios, such as ensuring proper cleanup of temporary files, closing network connections, or saving state before a script exits unexpectedly.
