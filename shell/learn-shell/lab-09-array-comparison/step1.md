# Create the script file

First, let's create a new file for our script.

1. Open a terminal in the WebIDE. You should see a command prompt ending with a `$` sign.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ~/project
```

This command changes your current directory to the project folder. The `~` symbol represents your home directory, and `/project` is a subfolder within it.

3. Create a new file named `array-comparison.sh`:

```bash
touch array-comparison.sh
```

The `touch` command creates an empty file. If the file already exists, it updates the file's timestamp without modifying its contents.

4. Open the file in the WebIDE editor. You can do this by clicking on the file name in the file explorer on the left side of your WebIDE interface.
