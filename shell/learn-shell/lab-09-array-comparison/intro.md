# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to compare arrays in Shell scripting. Arrays are useful data structures for storing multiple values, and comparing them is a common task in programming. You will work with three arrays and develop a script to find the common elements among them. This process will help you understand array manipulation, loops, and conditional statements in Shell scripting.
