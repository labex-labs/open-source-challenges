# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to compare arrays in Shell scripting. You created a script that finds common elements among three arrays using nested loops and conditional statements. This exercise demonstrated key concepts in Shell scripting, including:

1. Creating and initializing arrays
2. Using nested loops to compare array elements
3. Conditional statements to check for equality
4. Adding elements to arrays dynamically
5. Making a script executable and running it

These skills are fundamental in Shell scripting and can be applied to more complex data processing tasks in the future. As you continue to work with Shell scripts, you'll find that array manipulation is a powerful tool for handling sets of data efficiently.

Remember, practice is key to mastering these concepts. Try modifying the script to work with different arrays or to find unique elements instead of common ones. Happy scripting!
