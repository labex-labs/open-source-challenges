# Familiarize Yourself with the WebIDE (VS Code)

For this Shell scripting course, we'll be using a WebIDE based on Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This integrated development environment provides a convenient way to edit scripts and access the terminal all in one place.

### Accessing the WebIDE

When you start the lab, you'll see the WebIDE interface in your browser. It consists of several key parts:

1. File Explorer (left sidebar): Shows the directory structure and files.
2. Editor (main area): Where you'll write and edit your scripts.
3. Terminal (bottom panel): Where you'll run commands and execute scripts.

### Opening the Terminal

To open the terminal in the WebIDE:

1. Click on "Terminal" in the top menu.
2. Select "New Terminal" from the dropdown.

This will open a new terminal panel at the bottom of the WebIDE. You'll see a command prompt that looks similar to this:

```
labex@ubuntu:~/project$
```

This indicates that you're logged in as the user `labex`, on a machine named `ubuntu`, and your current directory is `~/project` (which is shorthand for `/home/labex/project`).

### Using the Terminal

You can use this terminal just like you would use a regular terminal on a Linux system. For example, to see the contents of your current directory, you can type:

```bash
ls
```

And press Enter. This will list all files and directories in your current location.
