# Add the Echo Command

The `echo` command is used to print messages to the screen. We will use it to print the "Hello, World!" message.

Add the following line below the shebang line:

```bash
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

This line will print the message "Hello, World!" to the screen.

The single quotes are used to enclose the message. You can also use double quotes, but single quotes are preferred in this case because the message does not contain any variables or special characters.

Save the `hello.sh` file and close the text editor. We will run the script in the next step to see the output.
