# Edit the Shell Script

Now that we've created the file, let's add some content to it. We'll use the WebIDE's built-in editor for this task.

If the file isn't already open in the editor:

1. In the File Explorer, double-click on `hello.sh` to open it.

In the editor, type the following two lines exactly as shown:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

Let's break down what these lines mean:

1. `#!/bin/bash` - This is called a "shebang" line. It tells the system which interpreter should be used to run this script. In this case, we're specifying the Bash shell.
2. `echo 'Hello, World!'` - This line uses the `echo` command to print the text "Hello, World!" to the screen.

After typing these lines, save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S` or by going to File > Save in the top menu.
