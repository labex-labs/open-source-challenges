# View the Script Contents

As a final step, let's view the contents of our script file to confirm everything is correct. We can do this using the `cat` command, which displays the contents of a file in the terminal.

Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

```bash
cat hello.sh
```

You should see the contents of your script displayed:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

This is a good habit to get into when working with scripts â€“ always double-check your work!
