# Create a Shell Script File

Now, let's create a new file for our shell script. We'll use the `touch` command in the terminal to do this. The `touch` command is used to create empty files or update the access and modification times of existing files.

Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

```bash
touch hello.sh
```

This command creates an empty file named `hello.sh` in your current directory. The `.sh` extension is commonly used for shell scripts, but it's not mandatory.

You won't see any output after running this command. In Unix-like systems, no output usually means the command was successful.

Alternatively, you can create the file using the WebIDE interface:

1. In the File Explorer, right-click in the `/home/labex/project` directory.
2. Select "New File" from the context menu.
3. Type the filename `hello.sh` and press Enter.

This will create a new file named `hello.sh` and open it in the editor.
