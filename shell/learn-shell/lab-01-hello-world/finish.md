# Summary

In this lab, you have successfully created and executed a simple Bash shell script. You've learned how to:

1. Navigate the WebIDE and use its integrated terminal
2. Create a new script file using either the `touch` command or the WebIDE interface
3. Edit a file using the WebIDE's built-in editor
4. Understand the purpose of the shebang line in shell scripts
5. Use the `echo` command to print text
6. Make a script executable using the `chmod` command
7. Run a shell script from the command line
8. View the contents of a file using the `cat` command

These fundamental skills form the basis for more advanced shell scripting and automation tasks in Unix-like environments. As you continue to learn, you'll discover how powerful and flexible shell scripting can be for managing systems and automating tasks.

Remember, practice is key in programming. Try modifying the script to print different messages or create new scripts to perform other simple tasks. Don't be afraid to experiment â€“ that's how you learn!
