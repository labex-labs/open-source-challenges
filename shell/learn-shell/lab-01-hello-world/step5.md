# Execute the Script

Now that our script is executable, we can run it. To run a script in the current directory, we use `./` before the script name. This `./` tells the system to look for the script in the current directory.

Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

```bash
./hello.sh
```

If everything has been done correctly, you should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've just run your first shell script.
