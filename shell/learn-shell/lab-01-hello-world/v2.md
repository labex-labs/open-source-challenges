# Hello World, Bash

## Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a simple shell script that prints the classic "Hello, World!" message. You will learn the fundamentals of shell programming using the Bash shell, which is widely used in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux. This lab is designed for beginners, so don't worry if you're new to programming or using the command line.

## Steps

### Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with the WebIDE (VS Code)

For this Shell scripting course, we'll be using a WebIDE based on Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This integrated development environment provides a convenient way to edit scripts and access the terminal all in one place.

#### Accessing the WebIDE

When you start the lab, you'll see the WebIDE interface in your browser. It consists of several key parts:

1. File Explorer (left sidebar): Shows the directory structure and files.
2. Editor (main area): Where you'll write and edit your scripts.
3. Terminal (bottom panel): Where you'll run commands and execute scripts.

#### Opening the Terminal

To open the terminal in the WebIDE:

1. Click on "Terminal" in the top menu.
2. Select "New Terminal" from the dropdown.

This will open a new terminal panel at the bottom of the WebIDE. You'll see a command prompt that looks similar to this:

```
labex@ubuntu:~/project$
```

This indicates that you're logged in as the user `labex`, on a machine named `ubuntu`, and your current directory is `~/project` (which is shorthand for `/home/labex/project`).

#### Using the Terminal

You can use this terminal just like you would use a regular terminal on a Linux system. For example, to see the contents of your current directory, you can type:

```bash
ls
```

And press Enter. This will list all files and directories in your current location.

### Step 2: Create a Shell Script File

Now, let's create a new file for our shell script. We'll use the `touch` command in the terminal to do this. The `touch` command is used to create empty files or update the access and modification times of existing files.

Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

```bash
touch hello.sh
```

This command creates an empty file named `hello.sh` in your current directory. The `.sh` extension is commonly used for shell scripts, but it's not mandatory.

You won't see any output after running this command. In Unix-like systems, no output usually means the command was successful.

Alternatively, you can create the file using the WebIDE interface:

1. In the File Explorer, right-click in the `/home/labex/project` directory.
2. Select "New File" from the context menu.
3. Type the filename `hello.sh` and press Enter.

This will create a new file named `hello.sh` and open it in the editor.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify Existence of hello.sh File
  script: |
    #!/bin/zsh
    ls /home/labex/project/hello.sh
  hint: The file hello.sh was not found in the /home/labex/project directory. Make sure you created the file either through the WebIDE interface or using the touch command in the terminal.
```

### Step 3: Edit the Shell Script

Now that we've created the file, let's add some content to it. We'll use the WebIDE's built-in editor for this task.

If the file isn't already open in the editor:

1. In the File Explorer, double-click on `hello.sh` to open it.

In the editor, type the following two lines exactly as shown:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

Let's break down what these lines mean:

1. `#!/bin/bash` - This is called a "shebang" line. It tells the system which interpreter should be used to run this script. In this case, we're specifying the Bash shell.
2. `echo 'Hello, World!'` - This line uses the `echo` command to print the text "Hello, World!" to the screen.

After typing these lines, save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S` or by going to File > Save in the top menu.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify Bash Shebang in hello.sh
  script: |
    #!/bin/zsh
    grep "#!/bin/bash" /home/labex/project/hello.sh
  hint: The shebang line (#!/bin/bash) is missing or incorrect in the hello.sh file. Make sure you typed it exactly as shown, including the #! at the beginning.

- name: Verify Presence of echo Command in hello.sh
  script: |
    #!/bin/zsh
    grep "echo 'Hello, World!'" /home/labex/project/hello.sh
  hint: The echo command with 'Hello, World!' message is missing or incorrect in the hello.sh file. Check that you typed it exactly as shown, including the single quotes around Hello, World!
```

### Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Before we can run our script, we need to make it executable. In Unix-like systems, files have permissions that control who can read, write, or execute them. By default, new files are not executable.

To make our script executable, we use the `chmod` command (which stands for "change mode"). Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
```

Here's what this command does:

- `chmod` is the command to change file permissions
- `+x` means "add execute permission"
- `hello.sh` is the name of our file

You won't see any output from this command if it's successful.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify Executable Permissions on hello.sh
  script: |
    #!/bin/zsh
    ls -l /home/labex/project/hello.sh | grep -E '^-..x'
  hint: The hello.sh file does not have executable permissions. Make sure you ran the chmod command correctly. You can try running it again if you're unsure.
```

### Step 5: Execute the Script

Now that our script is executable, we can run it. To run a script in the current directory, we use `./` before the script name. This `./` tells the system to look for the script in the current directory.

Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

```bash
./hello.sh
```

If everything has been done correctly, you should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've just run your first shell script.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify Script Output
  script: |
    #!/bin/zsh
    output=$(./hello.sh)
    if [ "$output" = "Hello, World!" ]; then
      exit 0
    else
      exit 1
    fi
  hint: The script did not produce the expected output "Hello, World!". Double-check the contents of your script using the cat command, and make sure you're running it with ./hello.sh
```

### Step 6: View the Script Contents

As a final step, let's view the contents of our script file to confirm everything is correct. We can do this using the `cat` command, which displays the contents of a file in the terminal.

Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:

```bash
cat hello.sh
```

You should see the contents of your script displayed:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

This is a good habit to get into when working with scripts – always double-check your work!

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify Script Contents
  script: |
    #!/bin/zsh
    cat /home/labex/project/hello.sh | grep -E '^#!/bin/bash$|^echo '"'"'Hello, World!'"'"'$'
  hint: The contents of hello.sh are not as expected. It should contain exactly two lines, the shebang (#!/bin/bash) and the echo command (echo 'Hello, World!'). Try editing the file again in the WebIDE.
```

## Summary

In this lab, you have successfully created and executed a simple Bash shell script. You've learned how to:

1. Navigate the WebIDE and use its integrated terminal
2. Create a new script file using either the `touch` command or the WebIDE interface
3. Edit a file using the WebIDE's built-in editor
4. Understand the purpose of the shebang line in shell scripts
5. Use the `echo` command to print text
6. Make a script executable using the `chmod` command
7. Run a shell script from the command line
8. View the contents of a file using the `cat` command

These fundamental skills form the basis for more advanced shell scripting and automation tasks in Unix-like environments. As you continue to learn, you'll discover how powerful and flexible shell scripting can be for managing systems and automating tasks.

Remember, practice is key in programming. Try modifying the script to print different messages or create new scripts to perform other simple tasks. Don't be afraid to experiment – that's how you learn!
