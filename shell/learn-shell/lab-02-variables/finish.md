# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to work with shell variables in Linux. You explored creating and referencing variables, using command substitution to assign command outputs to variables, performing arithmetic operations with variables, and working with environment variables. These skills form a crucial foundation for shell scripting and will be invaluable as you continue to work with Linux systems.

Key takeaways from this lab include:

- Creating and referencing shell variables
- Using special syntax for variable referencing in different scenarios
- Utilizing command substitution to capture command outputs
- Performing arithmetic operations with shell variables
- Working with environment variables

As you continue your journey in Linux and shell scripting, remember that variables are powerful tools for storing and manipulating data. Practice using them in your scripts to make your code more flexible and reusable.
