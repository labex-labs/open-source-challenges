# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to perform arithmetic operations using basic operators in Shell programming. You created a Bash script that calculates the total cost of a fruit basket by defining variables for individual costs and using arithmetic expressions to compute the total. You also learned how to make a script executable and run it from the command line.

Key points to remember:

1. Bash scripts start with a shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`).
2. Variables in Bash are assigned without spaces around the `=` sign.
3. Arithmetic operations in Bash are performed inside `$((  ))`.
4. The `echo` command is used to print output.
5. Scripts need to be made executable with `chmod +x` before they can be run.

These skills form the foundation for more complex shell scripting tasks and can be applied to various scenarios where you need to perform calculations within your scripts.
