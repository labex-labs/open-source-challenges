# Introduction

In this lab, you will explore the power of shell pipelines for efficient data processing. Pipelines, often referred to as pipes, allow you to connect multiple commands, channeling the output of one command into the input of another. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with complex or large datasets. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use pipelines to manipulate and analyze system information.
