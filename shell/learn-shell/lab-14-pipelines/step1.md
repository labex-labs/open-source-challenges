# Understanding the /proc Filesystem

The `/proc` filesystem is a virtual filesystem in Linux that provides information about the system's processes and other system information. It's called a "virtual" filesystem because it doesn't exist on disk - it's created by the Linux kernel in memory.

Let's start by examining its contents:

```bash
ls /proc
```

This command will list the contents of the `/proc` directory. You'll see numerous directories named with numbers (representing process IDs) and other special files.

Don't worry if you see a lot of output - that's normal! The `/proc` directory contains a file or directory for every process running on your system, plus additional files with system information.
