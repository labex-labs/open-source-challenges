# Summary

In this lab, you explored the power of shell pipelines for data processing. You learned how to combine commands like `cat`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `cut`, `head`, and `awk` to extract, filter, and analyze system information.

You started by exploring the `/proc` filesystem, then used various commands to analyze CPU and memory information. Along the way, you learned about important Linux commands and concepts:

- `cat` for displaying file contents
- `grep` for filtering text
- `wc` for counting
- `sort` and `uniq` for handling duplicate data
- `cut` for extracting parts of lines
- `head` for viewing the beginning of files
- `awk` for advanced text processing

These techniques are fundamental to shell scripting and can be applied to a wide range of data processing tasks in Linux systems. By mastering pipelines, you've gained a valuable tool for efficient command-line data manipulation and analysis.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Feel free to experiment with these commands on different files or combine them in new ways to solve different problems. The more you use these tools, the more comfortable and proficient you'll become with shell programming.
