# Exploring CPU Information

One of the special files in `/proc` is `cpuinfo`, which contains detailed information about the system's CPU. Let's view its contents:

```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

The `cat` command is short for "concatenate", but it's commonly used to display the contents of a file. In this case, it displays all the CPU information.

Take a moment to look through the output. You'll see details about each CPU core, including model name, clock speed, and cache size. Don't worry if you don't understand all the information - we'll focus on specific parts in the next steps.
