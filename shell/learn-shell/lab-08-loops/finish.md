# Summary

In this lab, you've learned about three types of loops in Bash scripting:

1. `for` loops, which iterate over a list of items or a range of numbers.
2. `while` loops, which continue as long as a condition is true.
3. `until` loops, which continue until a condition becomes true.

You've also learned about `break` and `continue` statements, which give you more control over your loops.

These loop structures are fundamental to many scripts and will allow you to automate repetitive tasks efficiently. Practice using these loops in your own scripts to become more familiar with their behavior and use cases.
