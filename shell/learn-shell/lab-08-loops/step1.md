# Setting Up the Environment

Let's start by setting up our working environment. We'll create a new directory to store all our loop experiments.

Open a terminal in the WebIDE. You should be in the `/home/labex/project` directory by default. If you're not sure, you can always navigate there using this command:

```bash
cd /home/labex/project
```

Now, let's create a new directory for our loop experiments:

```bash
mkdir bash_loops
cd bash_loops
```

This creates a new directory called `bash_loops` and changes into it. We'll use this directory for all our loop experiments.

Why are we doing this? Organizing your scripts into directories is a good practice. It keeps your work tidy and makes it easier to find and manage your files.
