# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use loops in Bash scripting. Loops allow you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, making your scripts more efficient and flexible. We will cover three types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `until`. Additionally, we will explore the `break` and `continue` statements, which allow you to control the loop execution.
