# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use loops in Bash scripting. Loops are powerful tools that allow you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, making your scripts more efficient and flexible. We will cover three types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `until`. Additionally, you will explore the `break` and `continue` statements, which provide control over loop execution. This lab is designed for beginners and will guide you through each concept step-by-step.
