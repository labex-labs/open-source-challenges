# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the lifecycle of a plot using Matplotlib. We started by creating a plot, controlling its style, customizing its appearance, combining multiple visualizations, and saving the plot to disk. Matplotlib offers a wide range of customization options to create visually appealing and informative plots.
