# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the lifecycle of a plot using Matplotlib. We will start with raw data and end by saving a customized visualization. We will learn how to create a plot, control its style, customize its appearance, combine multiple visualizations, and save the plot to disk.

> You can open the `04-the-lifecycle-of-a-plot.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
