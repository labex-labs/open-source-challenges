# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the lifecycle of a plot using Matplotlib. We will start with raw data and end by saving a customized visualization. We will learn how to create a plot, control its style, customize its appearance, combine multiple visualizations, and save the plot to disk.

> You can write code in `04-the-lifecycle-of-a-plot.ipynb`.
