# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to plot and manipulate images using the Matplotlib library in Python. You will learn how to import image data into NumPy arrays, plot numpy arrays as images, apply pseudocolor schemes, add color scale references, examine specific data ranges, and explore different interpolation schemes.

You can open the `03-image-plotting-with-matplotlib.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
