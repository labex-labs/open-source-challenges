# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a line plot using Matplotlib. Line plots are a basic visualization that can be used to represent data points connected by straight line segments. We will use the Matplotlib library in Python to create a line plot.

> You can write code in `01-create-a-line-plot-with-matplotlib.ipynb`.
