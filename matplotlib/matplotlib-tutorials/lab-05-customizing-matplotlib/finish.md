# Summary

Matplotlib provides multiple ways to customize the properties and default styles of plots. You can set rcParams at runtime, use style sheets to change the visual appearance of plots, and modify the `matplotlibrc` file to customize Matplotlib globally. Experiment with different customizations to create unique and visually appealing plots with Matplotlib.
