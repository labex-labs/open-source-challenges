# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a barcode using Matplotlib in Python. We first imported the necessary libraries, then created a binary array that will be used to generate the barcode. We then set the pixel and DPI values and created the figure and axes. Finally, we rendered the barcode using `Axes.imshow`.
