# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create date plots using Matplotlib in Python. We will use the `matplotlib.dates` module to convert datetime objects to Matplotlib's internal representation. We will also learn how to format the tick labels on the x-axis to display dates in a readable format.

> You can write code in `date.ipynb`.
