# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create date plots using Matplotlib in Python. We will use the `matplotlib.dates` module to convert datetime objects to Matplotlib's internal representation. We will also learn how to format the tick labels on the x-axis to display dates in a readable format.

You can open the `date.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
