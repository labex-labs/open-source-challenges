# Summary

This lab provided a step-by-step guide on how to use the `JoinStyle` module of Matplotlib in Python. We learned how to import required libraries, create a graph, set the `JoinStyle`, and display the graph. By adjusting the join style, we can change the appearance of corners where two different line segments meet in a graph.
