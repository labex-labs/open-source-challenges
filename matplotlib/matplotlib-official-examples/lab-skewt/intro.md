# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a SkewT-logP diagram using Matplotlib library in Python. A SkewT-logP diagram is commonly used in meteorology for displaying vertical profiles of temperature. It is a complex plot as it involves non-orthogonal X and Y axes. We will use the Matplotlib's transforms and custom projection API to create this plot.
