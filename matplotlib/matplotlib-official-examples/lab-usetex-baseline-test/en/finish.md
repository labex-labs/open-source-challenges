# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to compare the text baselines computed for mathtext and usetex using Matplotlib. We created a plot that contained two subplots, one with mathtext and the other with usetex. We added four test strings to each subplot, each with a different style and position. Finally, we displayed the plot to compare the text baselines.
