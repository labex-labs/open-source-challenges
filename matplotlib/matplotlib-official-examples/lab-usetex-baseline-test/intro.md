# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the text baselines computed for mathtext and usetex using Matplotlib library. We will create a plot that contains two subplots, one with mathtext and the other with usetex. Each subplot will display four test strings with different styles and positions.

> You can write code in `usetex-baseline-test.ipynb`.
