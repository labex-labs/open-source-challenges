# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the text baselines computed for mathtext and usetex using Matplotlib library. We will create a plot that contains two subplots, one with mathtext and the other with usetex. Each subplot will display four test strings with different styles and positions.

> You can open the `usetex-baseline-test.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
