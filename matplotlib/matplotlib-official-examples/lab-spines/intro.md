# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to customize spines in Matplotlib. Spines are the lines that connect the axis tick marks and demarcate the boundaries of the data area. By default, Matplotlib displays spines on all four sides of the plot. However, you may want to customize these spines to better highlight your data.

> You can open the `spines.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
