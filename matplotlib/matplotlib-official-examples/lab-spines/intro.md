# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to customize spines in Matplotlib. Spines are the lines that connect the axis tick marks and demarcate the boundaries of the data area. By default, Matplotlib displays spines on all four sides of the plot. However, you may want to customize these spines to better highlight your data.

> You can write code in `spines.ipynb`.
