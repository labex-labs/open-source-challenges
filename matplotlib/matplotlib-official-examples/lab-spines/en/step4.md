# Customize Spines for All Four Sides

In the first subplot, we will display spines on all four sides of the plot. We can access the spines of each subplot using the container `ax.spines`. We can then customize the spines using various methods.

```python
ax0.plot(x, y)
ax0.set_title('Normal Spines')
```
