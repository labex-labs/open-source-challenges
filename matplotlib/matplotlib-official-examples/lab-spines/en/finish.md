# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to customize spines in Matplotlib. Specifically, you learned how to display spines on specific sides of the plot, hide spines on specific sides of the plot, and limit the extent of each spine to the data range. By customizing spines, you can create plots that better highlight your data and improve their overall readability.
