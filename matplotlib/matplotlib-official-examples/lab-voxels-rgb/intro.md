# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D voxel plot with RGB colors using Matplotlib. Voxel plots are a way of representing 3D data on a 2D plot by using cubes to represent the data points. The RGB colors will be used to represent the different values of the data.

> You can write code in `voxels-rgb.ipynb`.
