# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D voxel plot with RGB colors using Matplotlib. Voxel plots are a way of representing 3D data on a 2D plot by using cubes to represent the data points. The RGB colors will be used to represent the different values of the data.

You can open the `voxels-rgb.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
