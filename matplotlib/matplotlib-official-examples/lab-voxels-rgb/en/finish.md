# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a 3D voxel plot with RGB colors using Matplotlib. We imported the required libraries, defined the coordinates and colors, created a sphere, combined the colors, and plotted the voxel plot. Voxel plots are a useful way to represent 3D data on a 2D plot, and can be customized with different colors and shapes to represent different types of data.
