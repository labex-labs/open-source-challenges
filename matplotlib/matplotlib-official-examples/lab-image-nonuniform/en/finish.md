# Summary

NonUniformImage is a useful tool for plotting images with non-uniform pixel positions. This lab provided a step-by-step guide on how to use NonUniformImage in Python's Matplotlib library, including importing the necessary libraries, creating linear and nonlinear arrays, creating subplots and NonUniformImage, and interpreting the results.
