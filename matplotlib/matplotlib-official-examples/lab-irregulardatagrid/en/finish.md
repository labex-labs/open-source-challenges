# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to create a contour plot of irregularly spaced data in Python using Matplotlib. We compared a contour plot of irregularly spaced data interpolated on a regular grid versus a tricontour plot for an unstructured triangular grid. The `axes.Axes.contour` and `axes.Axes.tricontour` methods were used to create the contour plots.
