# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to create a contour plot of irregularly spaced data in Python using Matplotlib. The contour plot shows the 2D distribution of data values using iso-contours or contour lines. In this example, we will compare a contour plot of irregularly spaced data interpolated on a regular grid versus a tricontour plot for an unstructured triangular grid.
