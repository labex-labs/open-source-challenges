# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to embed a Matplotlib plot in a GTK4 application using the FigureCanvasGTK4Agg widget. We created a GTK4 application window, a Matplotlib figure, and a GTK4 ScrolledWindow with a FigureCanvas as the child. Finally, we showed the application window and ran the GTK4 main loop.
