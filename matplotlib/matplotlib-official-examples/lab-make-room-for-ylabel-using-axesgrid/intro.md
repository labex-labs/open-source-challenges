# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that provides a variety of tools and techniques to create visually appealing graphs. Sometimes, it is necessary to make room for the y-label to avoid overlapping or truncating the text. This lab will show you how to use the axes_grid module to make room for the y-label in Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `make-room-for-ylabel-using-axesgrid.ipynb`.
