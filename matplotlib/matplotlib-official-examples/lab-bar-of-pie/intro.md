# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a "Bar of Pie" chart using Python's Matplotlib library. A Bar of Pie chart is a combination of a Pie chart and a stacked bar chart, where the first slice of the pie is exploded into a bar chart with a further breakdown of its characteristics. This chart is useful when you want to show the distribution of a whole data set, while also highlighting specific categories.
