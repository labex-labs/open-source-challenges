# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a Hat Graph in Python using the Matplotlib library. We defined a function that creates the Hat Graph, prepared the data, and created the graph using the `hat_graph` function. The Hat Graph is a variant of a stacked bar chart, where each bar is a hat shape. We used a dataset of scores by number of game and players to create the graph.
