# Prepare Data

In this step, we will initialise labels and a numpy array. We will make sure we have N labels of N number of values in the array.

```python
# initialise labels and a numpy array make sure you have
# N labels of N number of values in the array
xlabels = ['I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V']
playerA = np.array([5, 15, 22, 20, 25])
playerB = np.array([25, 32, 34, 30, 27])
```
