# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a Hat Graph in Python using the Matplotlib library. A Hat Graph is a variant of a stacked bar chart, where each bar is a hat shape. We will use a dataset of scores by number of game and players to create the graph.

> You can write code in `hat-graph.ipynb`.
