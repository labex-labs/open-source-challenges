# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to visualize discrete distributions using horizontal stacked bar charts. We will use Matplotlib, a popular plotting library in Python, to create a survey results visualization.

> You can open the `horizontal-barchart-distribution.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
