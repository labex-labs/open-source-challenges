# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a horizontal stacked bar chart to visualize discrete distributions using Matplotlib. We defined the categories and survey results, created a function to generate the plot, and displayed the results. This technique can be useful for visualizing survey results or other types of discrete distributions.
