# Matplotlib Tutorial: Setting Default Y-Axis Tick Labels on the Right

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to set the default y-axis tick labels on the right side of the plot using Matplotlib. By default, the y-axis tick labels are placed on the left side of the plot. However, sometimes it might be more suitable to have them on the right side instead.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries and modules

Before we start, we need to import the necessary libraries and modules. In this tutorial, we will be using Matplotlib and NumPy.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Set the default y-axis tick labels on the right

We can set the default y-axis tick labels on the right side of the plot using the following code:

```python
plt.rcParams['ytick.right'] = plt.rcParams['ytick.labelright'] = True
plt.rcParams['ytick.left'] = plt.rcParams['ytick.labelleft'] = False
```

### Step 3: Create a sample plot

Let's create a sample plot to see how it looks with the y-axis tick labels on the right side.

```python
x = np.arange(10)

fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True, figsize=(6, 6))

ax0.plot(x)
ax0.yaxis.tick_left()

ax1.plot(x)

plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Interpret the results

In the resulting plot, we can see that the y-axis tick labels are on the right side instead of the left side. The first plot has the y-axis tick labels on the left side because we specified it using the `ax0.yaxis.tick_left()` code. The second plot has the y-axis tick labels on the right side because we set the default y-axis tick labels on the right side using the code in Step 2.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to set the default y-axis tick labels on the right side of the plot using Matplotlib. This can be useful when we want to emphasize the right side of the plot or when we have multiple plots and want the y-axis tick labels to be consistent across all plots.
