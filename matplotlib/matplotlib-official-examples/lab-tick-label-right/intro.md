# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to set the default y-axis tick labels on the right side of the plot using Matplotlib. By default, the y-axis tick labels are placed on the left side of the plot. However, sometimes it might be more suitable to have them on the right side instead.

> You can write code in `tick-label-right.ipynb`.
