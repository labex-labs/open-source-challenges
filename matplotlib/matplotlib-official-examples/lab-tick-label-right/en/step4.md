# Interpret the results

In the resulting plot, we can see that the y-axis tick labels are on the right side instead of the left side. The first plot has the y-axis tick labels on the left side because we specified it using the `ax0.yaxis.tick_left()` code. The second plot has the y-axis tick labels on the right side because we set the default y-axis tick labels on the right side using the code in Step 2.
