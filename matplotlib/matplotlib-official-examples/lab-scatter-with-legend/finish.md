# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create scatter plots with legends in Python using Matplotlib library. We created scatter plots with multiple groups and automated legend creation. We also customized the legend elements using the `PathCollection.legend_elements` method. Scatter plots with legends are useful for visualizing the relationship between two variables with multiple groups.
