# Introduction

Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two variables. A scatter plot with a legend is useful when there are multiple groups in the data, and we want to distinguish between them in the plot. In this lab, we will learn how to create scatter plots with legends in Python using Matplotlib library.

> You can write code in `scatter-with-legend.ipynb`.
