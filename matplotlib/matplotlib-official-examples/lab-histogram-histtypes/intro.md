# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a histogram using Matplotlib library. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable. To create a histogram, we need to split the entire range of values into a series of intervals or bins, and then count how many values fall into each interval.
