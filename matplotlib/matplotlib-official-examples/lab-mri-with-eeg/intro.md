# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a visualization of an MRI image with EEG traces using Python Matplotlib. You will learn how to load and display MRI and EEG data, plot an intensity histogram of the MRI image, and plot EEG traces with time on the x-axis and electrode channels on the y-axis.

You can open the `mri-with-eeg.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
