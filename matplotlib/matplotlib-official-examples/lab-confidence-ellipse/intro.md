# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to plot confidence ellipses of a two-dimensional dataset using Python Matplotlib. A confidence ellipse is a graphical representation of the covariance of a dataset, showing the uncertainty of the estimated mean and standard deviation. The ellipses are plotted using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

> You can write code in `confidence-ellipse.ipynb`.
