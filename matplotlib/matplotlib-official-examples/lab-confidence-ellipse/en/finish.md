# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to plot confidence ellipses of a two-dimensional dataset using Python Matplotlib. We defined the `confidence_ellipse` and `get_correlated_dataset` functions, and used them to plot ellipses of datasets with different correlations and number of standard deviations. We also showed how to customize the appearance of the ellipses using keyword arguments.
