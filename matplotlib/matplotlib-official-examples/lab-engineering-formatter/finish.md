# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to label ticks on an axis using engineering notation. We used the `EngFormatter` class in Matplotlib to label the ticks on the x-axis of a plot. We also learned how to create subplots and customize the tick labels using the `EngFormatter` options `places` and `sep`. Engineering notation is a concise and clear way to express large or small numbers that are difficult to read or write in standard notation.
