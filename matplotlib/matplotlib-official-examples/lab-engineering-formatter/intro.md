# Introduction

In data visualization, it is essential to label the ticks on axes accurately. The `EngFormatter` in Matplotlib is a class that enables one to label the ticks on an axis using engineering notation. Engineering notation is a mathematical representation of numbers that uses powers of ten with a multiple of three. It is a concise way to express large or small numbers that are difficult to read or write in standard notation. In this lab, we will learn how to label ticks on an axis using engineering notation.

You can open the `engineering-formatter.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
