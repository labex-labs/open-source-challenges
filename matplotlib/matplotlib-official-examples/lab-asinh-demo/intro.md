# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It provides a variety of tools for creating a wide range of graphs, charts, and plots. One of the most powerful features of Matplotlib is its ability to scale data. This lab will introduce you to the AsinhScale, which is a transformation that allows for plotting quantities that cover a very wide dynamic range that includes both positive and negative values.

> You can write code in `asinh-demo.ipynb`.
