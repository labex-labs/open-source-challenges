# Summary

This lab introduced the AsinhScale in Matplotlib, which is a transformation that allows for plotting quantities that cover a very wide dynamic range that includes both positive and negative values. We learned how to create sample data and how to plot graphs with "symlog" and "asinh". We also learned how to compare "asinh" graphs with different scale parameters and how to compare "symlog" and "asinh" scalings on 2D Cauchy-distributed random numbers.
