# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library that is widely used in Python. It allows users to create a wide variety of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and more. In this lab, you will learn how to use the `symlog` axis scaling in Matplotlib to create symmetric log plots.

> You can open the `symlog-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
