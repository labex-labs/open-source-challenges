# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to control the style of text and labels in a Matplotlib plot using a dictionary. By creating a dictionary of options, we can share parameters across multiple text objects and labels. This will allow us to easily customize the font family, color, weight, and size of text in our plots.

> You can write code in `text-fontdict.ipynb`.
