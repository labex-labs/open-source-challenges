# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to control the style of text and labels in a Matplotlib plot using a dictionary. By creating a font dictionary, we can easily customize the font family, color, weight, and size of text in our plots. We used this technique to customize the title, text, and axis labels of our plot, and adjusted the spacing to prevent clipping of the ylabel.
