# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create shaded relief plots using Python Matplotlib. Shaded relief plots are useful for visualizing terrain data, as they use shading to represent variations in elevation.

You can open the `shading-example.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
