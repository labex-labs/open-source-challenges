# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an Ishikawa diagram, also known as a fishbone diagram or cause-and-effect diagram. Ishikawa diagrams are commonly used to identify problems in a system by showing how causes and effects are linked. We will use Python and the Matplotlib library to create the diagram.

> You can open the `ishikawa-diagram.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
