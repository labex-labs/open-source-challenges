# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of adding annotations to your Matplotlib plots. Annotations help to highlight specific data points or provide additional information to the viewer. The annotations can include text, arrows, and shapes. You will learn how to add annotations to your plot, customize them, and position them.

> You can write code in `simple-annotate01.ipynb`.
