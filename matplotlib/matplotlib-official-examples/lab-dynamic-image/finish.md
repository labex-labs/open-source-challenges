# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create an animated image using precomputed lists of images. We used the Matplotlib library in Python to create the animation and the Numpy library to generate the data for the animation. We created the figure and axes objects, defined the function, generated the data, created the animation frames, and created the animation. We then displayed the animation using the show method. This lab provided a basic understanding of how to create an animated image and demonstrated the process of doing so.
