# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an animated image using precomputed lists of images. We will be using the Matplotlib library in Python to create the animation. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the process of creating an animated image and to provide a basic understanding of how it works.

> You can write code in `dynamic-image.ipynb`.
