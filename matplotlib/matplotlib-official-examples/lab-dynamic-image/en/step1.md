# Import Libraries

To start, we need to import the libraries that we will be using. We will be using the Matplotlib library to create the animation and the Numpy library to generate the data for the animation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.animation as animation
```
