# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to move the x-axis tick labels to the top of the plot using Python's Matplotlib library. This can be useful when the x-axis labels are too long and interfere with the plot's readability.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.
