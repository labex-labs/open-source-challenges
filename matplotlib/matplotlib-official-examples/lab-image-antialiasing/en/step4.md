# Upsample Image with 'nearest' Interpolation

Now, we will upsample the image from 500 data pixels to 530 rendered pixels using 'nearest' interpolation. This will demonstrate how the Moir√© patterns can still occur even when the image is upsampled if the upsampling factor is not an integer.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6.8, 6.8))
ax.imshow(a, interpolation='nearest', cmap='gray')
ax.set_title("upsampled by factor a 1.048, interpolation='nearest'")
plt.show()
```
