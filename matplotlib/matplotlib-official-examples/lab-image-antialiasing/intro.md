# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of antialiasing an image using Matplotlib in Python. Antialiasing is a technique used to smooth out jagged edges and reduce distortion in images. In this tutorial, we will use Matplotlib to generate a 450x450 pixel image with varying frequency content. We will then subsample the image from 450 data pixels to either 125 pixels or 250 pixels to demonstrate how antialiasing can be used to reduce the Moir√© patterns caused by high-frequency data being subsampled.

You can open the `image-antialiasing.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
