# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `LineCollection` function in Matplotlib to efficiently draw multiple lines at once. We will see how to plot multiple lines with different colors and styles, and how to use a masked array to mask some values. We will also learn how to use the `ScalarMappable.set_array` function to map an array of values to colors.

You can open the `line-collection.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
