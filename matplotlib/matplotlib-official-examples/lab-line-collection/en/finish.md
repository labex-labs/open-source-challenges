# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the `LineCollection` function in Matplotlib to efficiently draw multiple lines at once. We saw how to plot multiple lines with different colors and styles, and how to use a masked array to mask some values. We also learned how to use the `ScalarMappable.set_array` function to map an array of values to colors.
