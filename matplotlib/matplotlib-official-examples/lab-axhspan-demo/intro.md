# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create lines and rectangles that span the axes in either the horizontal or vertical direction, and lines than span the axes with an arbitrary orientation using Matplotlib library in Python.

You can open the `axhspan-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
