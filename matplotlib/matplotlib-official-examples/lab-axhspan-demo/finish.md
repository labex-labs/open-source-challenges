# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create lines and rectangles that span the axes in either the horizontal or vertical direction, and lines than span the axes with an arbitrary orientation using Matplotlib library in Python. We learned how to import the required libraries, generate data, create a figure and axes, plot data, and add horizontal and vertical lines, infinite line, and rectangle to the graph.
