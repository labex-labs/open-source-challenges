# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to manage multiple figures in Matplotlib's pyplot. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python, and pyplot is a sub-library within Matplotlib that provides a simple interface for creating, customizing, and organizing plots. You will learn how to create and switch between multiple figures, create subplots within each figure, and make changes to specific subplots.
