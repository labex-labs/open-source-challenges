# Introduction

This lab will guide you through annotating plots in Matplotlib. You will learn how to highlight specific points of interest and use various visual tools to call attention to these points. Annotation and text tools are essential for conveying information and making plots more visually appealing.

> You can open the `annotation-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
