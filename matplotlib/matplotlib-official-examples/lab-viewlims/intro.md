# Introduction

In data visualization, zooming in on a specific area of a plot can be extremely useful to better understand and analyze the data. Matplotlib, a popular data visualization library for Python, provides a way to create two identical panels and zoom in on the right panel to show a rectangle in the first panel, denoting the zoomed region. In this lab, we will learn how to create this interactive zooming feature in Matplotlib.
