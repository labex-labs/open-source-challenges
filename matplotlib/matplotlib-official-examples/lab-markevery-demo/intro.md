# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the `markevery` property of `Line2D` to draw markers at a subset of data points in Matplotlib. We will cover various ways to specify the markers, including using integers, tuples, lists, slices, and floats. We will also explore how `markevery` behaves with linear and logarithmic scales, as well as with zoomed and polar plots.
