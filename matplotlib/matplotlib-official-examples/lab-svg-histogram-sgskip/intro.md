# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an interactive histogram using Matplotlib. The interactivity is encoded in ECMAScript (JavaScript) and inserted in the SVG code in a post-processing step. The resulting histogram will have bars that can be hidden or shown by clicking on legend markers.

> You can open the `svg-histogram-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

> Labby cannot automatically verify the answers because it cannot access the notebook.
