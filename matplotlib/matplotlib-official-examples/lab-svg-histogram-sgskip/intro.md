# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an interactive histogram using Matplotlib. The interactivity is encoded in ECMAScript (JavaScript) and inserted in the SVG code in a post-processing step. The resulting histogram will have bars that can be hidden or shown by clicking on legend markers.

> You can write code in `svg-histogram-sgskip.ipynb`.
