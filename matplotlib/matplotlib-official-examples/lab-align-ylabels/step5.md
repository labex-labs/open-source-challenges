# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to align y-labels in Matplotlib plots. The alignment of y-labels is important for improving the readability of plots, especially when there are multiple subplots. We covered two methods for aligning y-labels, one using a short call to `.Figure.align_ylabels` and the second a manual way to align the labels.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to align y-labels in Matplotlib plots. Keep practicing and exploring the Matplotlib library to improve your visualization skills.
