# Import Required Libraries

To create a packed-bubble chart, we need to import the `matplotlib.pyplot` and `numpy` libraries. The `numpy` library is used to perform mathematical operations on arrays, which is useful for calculating bubble sizes.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
