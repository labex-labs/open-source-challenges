# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a packed-bubble chart using Matplotlib in Python. The packed-bubble chart is a type of chart that displays data in bubbles of different sizes, with the bubble's size representing the data's magnitude. This chart is useful for displaying scalar data, where the data is a single numeric value associated with an item.
