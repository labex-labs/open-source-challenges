# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a packed-bubble chart using Matplotlib in Python. We defined the data as a dictionary containing the browser names, market share, and color for each bubble. We then created a `BubbleChart` class to set up the initial positions of the bubbles, calculate the maximum step distance, move the bubbles towards the center of mass, and check for collisions with other bubbles. Finally, we plotted the chart using `matplotlib`.
