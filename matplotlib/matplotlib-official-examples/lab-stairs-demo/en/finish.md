# Summary

This tutorial covered the basics of creating stepwise histograms using Matplotlib. We learned how to create simple step histograms, modify the baseline of histograms, create filled and hatched histograms, and create stacked histograms. We also compared the differences between `.pyplot.step` and `.pyplot.stairs`.
