# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create an interactive game of Pong using Matplotlib. You learned how to define the `Pad` and `Puck` classes, as well as the `Game` class, which is responsible for handling the game logic and drawing the game on the screen. You also learned how to create the game animation by instantiating a `Game` object and calling its `draw()` method in a loop. With this knowledge, you can now create your own interactive games using Python and Matplotlib.
