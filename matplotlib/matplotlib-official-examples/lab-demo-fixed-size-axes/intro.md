# Introduction

In data visualization, it's important to have consistent axes sizes in order to make meaningful comparisons between different plots. The Matplotlib library provides a way to create fixed size axes for figures that do not change size. In this lab, we will learn how to create fixed size axes using Matplotlib.

You can open the `demo-fixed-size-axes.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
