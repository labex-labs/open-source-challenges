# Introduction

In data visualization, it's important to have consistent axes sizes in order to make meaningful comparisons between different plots. The Matplotlib library provides a way to create fixed size axes for figures that do not change size. In this lab, we will learn how to create fixed size axes using Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `demo-fixed-size-axes.ipynb`.
