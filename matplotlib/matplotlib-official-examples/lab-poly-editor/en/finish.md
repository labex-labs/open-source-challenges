# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a polygon editor using Matplotlib event handling. We created a class to handle all the interactions with the polygon, and we used the `Polygon` class to create the polygon itself. We then created the plot and added the polygon to it. With this knowledge, you can create your own interactive applications using Matplotlib.
