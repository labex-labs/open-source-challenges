# Create a Function to Calculate Distance

We need to create a function that calculates the distance between a point and a line segment. This function will be used later to determine if a new vertex should be added to the polygon.

```python
def dist_point_to_segment(p, s0, s1):
    """
    Get the distance from the point *p* to the segment (*s0*, *s1*), where
    *p*, *s0*, *s1* are ``[x, y]`` arrays.
    """
    s01 = s1 - s0
    s0p = p - s0
    if (s01 == 0).all():
        return np.hypot(*s0p)
    # Project onto segment, without going past segment ends.
    p1 = s0 + np.clip((s0p @ s01) / (s01 @ s01), 0, 1) * s01
    return np.hypot(*(p - p1))
```
