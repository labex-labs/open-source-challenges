# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to build cross-GUI applications using Matplotlib event handling to interact with objects on the canvas. We will be creating a polygon editor that allows you to move, delete, and insert vertices.

> You can open the `poly-editor.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
