# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to build cross-GUI applications using Matplotlib event handling to interact with objects on the canvas. We will be creating a polygon editor that allows you to move, delete, and insert vertices.

> You can write code in `poly-editor.ipynb`.
