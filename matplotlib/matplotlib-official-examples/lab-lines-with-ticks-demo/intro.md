# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to add ticks along a line in Matplotlib using Ticked Patheffect. Ticks can be added to mark one side as a barrier and you can control the angle, spacing, and length of the ticks. Ticks will also appear appropriately in the legend.

> You can open the `lines-with-ticks-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
