# Summary

This lab provided an overview of how to create annotation connection styles using the Matplotlib library in Python. Annotations are a useful tool in data visualization and can be used to explain or highlight specific data points on a graph. The connection style of an annotation refers to the shape and style of the line connecting the annotation to the data point. By following the steps outlined in this lab, you should now be able to create your own annotation connection styles in Matplotlib.
