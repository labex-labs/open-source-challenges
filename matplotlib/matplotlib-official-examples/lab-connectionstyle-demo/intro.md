# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating annotation connection styles using the Matplotlib library in Python. Annotations are an important tool in data visualization as they help to explain or highlight specific data points on a graph. The connection style of an annotation refers to the shape and style of the line connecting the annotation to the data point.

> You can write code in `connectionstyle-demo.ipynb`.
