# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to concatenate text objects with different properties using Matplotlib. Concatenation is the process of combining multiple text objects into a single string. This can be useful when creating annotations or labels for visualizations.

> You can write code in `rainbow-text.ipynb`.
