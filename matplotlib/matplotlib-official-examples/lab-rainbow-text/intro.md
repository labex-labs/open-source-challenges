# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to concatenate text objects with different properties using Matplotlib. Concatenation is the process of combining multiple text objects into a single string. This can be useful when creating annotations or labels for visualizations.

You can open the `rainbow-text.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
