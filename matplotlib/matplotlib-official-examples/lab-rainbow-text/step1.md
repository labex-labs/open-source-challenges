# Create the First Text Object

The first step is to create the first text object using `~.Axes.text`. This text object will be the starting point for the concatenation process. The following code creates a red text object with the word "Matplotlib" at position (0.1, 0.5) on the plot.

```python
text = ax.text(.1, .5, "Matplotlib", color="red")
```
