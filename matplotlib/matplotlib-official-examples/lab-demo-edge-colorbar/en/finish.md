# Summary

Matplotlib provides a simple way to create image grids with colorbars using the AxesGrid toolkit. This lab demonstrated how to create a grid of 2x2 images with a colorbar for each column and a grid of 2x2 images with a colorbar for each row. By following these steps, you can create image grids with colorbars for your own datasets.
