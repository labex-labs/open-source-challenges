# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a wxPython application that displays math text in a wx.Bitmap for display in various controls on wxPython. It uses the Matplotlib library to convert text to images and the wxPython library to display the images.

You can open the `mathtext-wx-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
