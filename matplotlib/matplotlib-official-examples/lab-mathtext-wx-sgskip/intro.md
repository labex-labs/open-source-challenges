# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a wxPython application that displays math text in a wx.Bitmap for display in various controls on wxPython. It uses the Matplotlib library to convert text to images and the wxPython library to display the images.

> You can write code in `mathtext-wx-sgskip.ipynb`.
