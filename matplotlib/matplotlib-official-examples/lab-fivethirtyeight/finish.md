# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a simple line plot using the "fivethirtyeight" style sheet in Matplotlib. We covered the basics of creating a figure and axes object, plotting data, and setting the title and labels for the plot. With these skills, you can create a wide range of visualizations using Matplotlib.
