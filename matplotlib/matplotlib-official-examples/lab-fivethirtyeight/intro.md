# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating a wide range of visualizations, from simple line plots to complex heatmaps. In this lab, we will go through the basics of Matplotlib and create a simple line plot using the "fivethirtyeight" style sheet.
