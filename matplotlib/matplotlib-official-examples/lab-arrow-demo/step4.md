# Interpret the Arrow Graph

The fourth step is to interpret the arrow graph. The length, width, and opacity of the arrows represent the arrow strength. The arrow graph can be used to encode arrow "strength" such as transition probabilities in a Markov model using arrow length, width, or alpha (opacity). The labels on the arrows represent the probabilities for the bases and pair transitions.
