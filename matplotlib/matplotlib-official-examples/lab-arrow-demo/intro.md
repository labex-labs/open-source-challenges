# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python. It provides a variety of customizable visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar graphs, histograms, and more. One of the visualizations that Matplotlib provides is the Arrow Plot. Arrow plots are used to encode arrow "strength" such as transition probabilities in a Markov model using arrow length, width, or alpha (opacity).

In this lab, we will learn how to create arrow plots using Matplotlib. We will use the `make_arrow_graph()` function to plot the arrow graph.
