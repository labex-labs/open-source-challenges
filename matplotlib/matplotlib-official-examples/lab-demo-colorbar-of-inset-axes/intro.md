# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to add a colorbar to inset axes using Matplotlib in Python. A colorbar is a visual representation of the mapping of a range of colors to a range of numerical values. An inset axis is a smaller axis that is placed within the larger axis of a plot.

> You can write code in `demo-colorbar-of-inset-axes.ipynb`.
