# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `contourf` function in Matplotlib to create filled contour plots with a logarithmic color scale. We will use a dataset with positive and negative values to demonstrate this feature.

> You can open the `contourf-log.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
