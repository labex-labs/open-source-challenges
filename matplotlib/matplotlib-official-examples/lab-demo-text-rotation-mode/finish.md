# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to rotate text in Matplotlib using the `rotation_mode` parameter. We created a function called `test_rotation_mode` that created subplots to test the different rotation modes. We defined the horizontal and vertical alignment lists, created the subplots, added text to the subplots, and highlighted the bounding box of the text. Finally, we created the subfigures and called the `test_rotation_mode` function.
