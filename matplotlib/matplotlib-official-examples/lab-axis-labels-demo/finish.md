# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to set the position of axis labels and colorbar labels in Matplotlib. We used the `set_xlabel`, `set_ylabel`, and `colorbar` methods to set the position of the labels. We also learned that we can set the position to `'top'`, `'bottom'`, `'left'`, `'right'`, `'center'`, or `'baseline'`.
