# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to set the position of axis labels and colorbar labels in Matplotlib. We will use the `set_xlabel`, `set_ylabel`, and `colorbar` methods to set the position of the labels.

> You can open the `axis-labels-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
