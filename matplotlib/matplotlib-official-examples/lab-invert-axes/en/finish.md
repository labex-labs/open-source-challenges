# Summary

Inverting the axes of a Matplotlib plot can be useful when visualizing data with a non-linear relationship. This lab provided a step-by-step guide on how to invert the x-axis of a plot using Matplotlib in Python. By reversing the order of the x-axis limits, we can effectively invert the x-axis of our plot.
