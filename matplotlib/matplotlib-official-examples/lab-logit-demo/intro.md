# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create plots with logit axes in Matplotlib. Logit axes are commonly used in probability plots to represent the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a distribution. We will use the `math`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries for this lab.

You can open the `logit-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
