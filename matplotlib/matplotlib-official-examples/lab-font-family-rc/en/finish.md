# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to configure the font family and style in Matplotlib. We explored how to choose the default sans-serif and monospace fonts, as well as how to specify specific fonts for each family. By setting these parameters, we can ensure that our plots and visualizations are legible and consistent in appearance.
