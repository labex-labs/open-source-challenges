# Introduction

In Matplotlib, it is possible to configure the font family and style used in plots and visualizations. This is useful for ensuring consistency in the appearance of text across multiple plots and for ensuring that text is legible and easy to read. In this lab, we will explore how to configure the font family and style in Matplotlib.
