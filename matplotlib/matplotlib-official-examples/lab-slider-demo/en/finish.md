# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create sliders and use them to control a sine wave's frequency and amplitude. We used the Matplotlib library to create a graph of the sine wave and the sliders. We created a horizontal slider to control the frequency and a vertical slider to control the amplitude. We also created a reset button that reset the sliders to their initial values.
