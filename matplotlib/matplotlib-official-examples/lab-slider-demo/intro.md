# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create sliders and use them to control a sine wave's frequency and amplitude. We will use the Matplotlib library to create a graph of the sine wave and the sliders. The sliders will allow us to adjust the frequency and amplitude of the sine wave.

You can open the `slider-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
