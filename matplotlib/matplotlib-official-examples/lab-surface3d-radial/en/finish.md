# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to create a 3D surface with polar coordinates using Python Matplotlib library. We started by importing the required libraries, created a mesh in polar coordinates, expressed the mesh in the cartesian system, plotted the surface, and finally tweaked the limits and added axis labels.
