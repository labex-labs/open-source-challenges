# Import Required Libraries

We will begin by importing the required libraries for this lab, which include Matplotlib and NumPy. Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python, while NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
