# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to adjust spine positions in Matplotlib by setting the position of the axis spines using the `set_position` method, and how to define a method to adjust spine locations based on the desired spine locations. This can be useful for customizing the appearance of plots and highlighting specific features.
