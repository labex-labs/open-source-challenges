# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to format the y-axis labels of a plot to display dollar signs. This is particularly useful when working with financial data or any data that requires currency formatting.

You can open the `dollar-ticks.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
