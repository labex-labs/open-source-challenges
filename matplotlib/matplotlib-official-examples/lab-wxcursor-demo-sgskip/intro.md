# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding a cursor in WX to report data coordinates. We will be using Matplotlib, a plotting library for Python that provides tools to create a variety of plots, charts, and graphs.

> You can write code in `wxcursor-demo-sgskip.ipynb`.
