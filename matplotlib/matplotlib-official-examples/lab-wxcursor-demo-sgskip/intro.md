# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding a cursor in WX to report data coordinates. We will be using Matplotlib, a plotting library for Python that provides tools to create a variety of plots, charts, and graphs.

You can open the `wxcursor-demo-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
