# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create contour labels in Matplotlib. We covered some advanced techniques for creating custom contour labels, including custom level formatters, labeling contours with arbitrary strings, and using a formatter to format the contour labels. These techniques can be useful for creating visualizations that are both informative and aesthetically pleasing.
