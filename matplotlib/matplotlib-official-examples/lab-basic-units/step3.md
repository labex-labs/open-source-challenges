# Perform Unit Conversions

Unit conversions can be performed using the `convert_to` method of `TaggedValue`.

```python
# convert cm to inch
print(length.convert_to(inch))

# convert radians to degrees
print(radians.convert_to(degrees))

# convert seconds to minutes
print(time.convert_to(minutes))
```
