# Introduction

In scientific calculations, it is important to keep track of the units of measurement. The `BasicUnit` class and `TaggedValue` class in this lab provide a convenient way to represent values with units and perform unit conversions. In this lab, you will learn how to use these classes to perform basic unit conversions and use them with Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `basic-units.ipynb`.
