# Interpret the Plot

In this step, we will interpret the scatter plot generated in Step 4. The plot shows the relationship between the `a` and `b` variables, with the `c` variable used to determine the color of each point and the `d` variable used to determine the size of each point. The x-axis represents `entry a` and the y-axis represents `entry b`.
