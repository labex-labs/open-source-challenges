# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating visualizations in Python. Sometimes, when creating plots, you may need to adjust the subplot parameters manually. This lab will show you how to programmatically adjust subplot parameters based on the size of the labels.

> You can write code in `auto-subplots-adjust.ipynb`.
