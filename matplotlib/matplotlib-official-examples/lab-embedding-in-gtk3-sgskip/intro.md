# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to embed a Matplotlib figure into a GTK3 application using the `FigureCanvasGTK3Agg` widget. GTK, or GIMP Toolkit, is a popular widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

> You can write code in `embedding-in-gtk3-sgskip.ipynb`.
