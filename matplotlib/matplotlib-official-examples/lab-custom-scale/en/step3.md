# Implement the MercatorLatitudeTransform class

Inside the `MercatorLatitudeScale` class, we will define the `MercatorLatitudeTransform` class that will actually transform the data. This class will inherit from `mtransforms.Transform`.

```python
    class MercatorLatitudeTransform(mtransforms.Transform):
        # There are two value members that must be defined.
        # ``input_dims`` and ``output_dims`` specify number of input
        # dimensions and output dimensions to the transformation.
        # These are used by the transformation framework to do some
        # error checking and prevent incompatible transformations from
        # being connected together.  When defining transforms for a
        # scale, which are, by definition, separable and have only one
        # dimension, these members should always be set to 1.
        input_dims = output_dims = 1

        def __init__(self, thresh):
            mtransforms.Transform.__init__(self)
            self.thresh = thresh

        def transform_non_affine(self, a):
            """
            This transform takes a numpy array and returns a transformed copy.
            Since the range of the Mercator scale is limited by the
            user-specified threshold, the input array must be masked to
            contain only valid values.  Matplotlib will handle masked arrays
            and remove the out-of-range data from the plot.  However, the
            returned array *must* have the same shape as the input array, since
            these values need to remain synchronized with values in the other
            dimension.

            masked = ma.masked_where((a < -self.thresh) | (a > self.thresh), a)
            if masked.mask.any():
                return ma.log(np.abs(ma.tan(masked) + 1 / ma.cos(masked)))
            else:
                return np.log(np.abs(np.tan(a) + 1 / np.cos(a)))
