# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library for Python. It provides a number of built-in scales for plotting data, but sometimes you may need a custom scale for your specific use case. In this lab, we will show you how to create a custom scale that uses the Mercator projection for latitude data.

You can open the `custom-scale.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
