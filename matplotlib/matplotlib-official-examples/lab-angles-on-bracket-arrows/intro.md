# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to add angle annotations to bracket arrow styles created using `FancyArrowPatch` in Matplotlib. Angle annotations are useful for indicating the direction and size of angles in a plot. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create bracket arrow styles with angle annotations and customize them to fit your specific needs.

> You can write code in `angles-on-bracket-arrows.ipynb`.
