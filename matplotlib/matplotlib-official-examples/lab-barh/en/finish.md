# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a horizontal bar chart using Python Matplotlib. We saw how to prepare data, create the figure and axes objects, and customize the chart. We also learned about the `barh()` method of the axes object and how to show the chart using the `show()` method of the `pyplot` object.
