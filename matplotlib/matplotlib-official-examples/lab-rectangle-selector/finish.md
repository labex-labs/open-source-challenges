# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the RectangleSelector and EllipseSelector widgets in Matplotlib to draw a rectangle or ellipse from the initial click position to the current mouse position. We also learned how to create a figure with subplots, plot something on the subplots, and toggle the active status of the widgets using a key press event.
