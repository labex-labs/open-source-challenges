# Introduction

In data analysis, we often want to display data that depends on two independent variables as a color-coded image plot known as a heatmap. In this lab, we will use Matplotlib's `imshow` function to create a heatmap with annotations. We will start with a simple example and expand it to be usable as a universal function.
