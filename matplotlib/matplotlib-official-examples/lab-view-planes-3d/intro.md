# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to generate an "unfolded" 3D plot using Matplotlib that shows each of the primary 3D view planes. We will also label the elevation, azimuth, and roll angles required for each view. This image can be printed out and folded into a box where each plane forms a side of the box.

> You can open the `view-planes-3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
