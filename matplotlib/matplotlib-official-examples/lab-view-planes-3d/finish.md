# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to generate an "unfolded" 3D plot that shows each of the primary 3D view planes using Matplotlib. We also labeled the elevation, azimuth, and roll angles required for each view and customized the tick labels and axis labels for each primary 3D view plane. This image can be printed out and folded into a box where each plane forms a side of the box.
