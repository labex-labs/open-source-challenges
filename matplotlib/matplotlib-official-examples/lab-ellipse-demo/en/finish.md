# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to use Python Matplotlib to draw ellipses. We have covered two examples: drawing individual ellipses and drawing ellipses with different angles. By following the steps in this lab, you should be able to draw ellipses in your own Python projects using Matplotlib.
