# Importing Required Libraries

First, we need to import the required libraries. We will use `numpy` to generate random data, and `matplotlib.pyplot` and `matplotlib.patches` to draw the ellipses.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.patches import Ellipse
```
