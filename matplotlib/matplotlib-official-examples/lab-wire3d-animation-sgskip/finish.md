# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to animate a 3D wireframe plot using Matplotlib. We used a for loop to iterate through a range of values for phi, generated new data, plotted the new wireframe, and paused briefly before continuing. Finally, we displayed the average frames per second (FPS) using the total time it took to run the animation.
