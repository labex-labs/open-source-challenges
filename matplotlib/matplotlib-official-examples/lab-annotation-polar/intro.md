# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a polar graph and annotate it using Python Matplotlib library. A polar graph is a graph drawn using polar coordinates. It is useful for visualizing cyclic phenomena such as waves, seasons, and tides.

> You can open the `annotation-polar.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
