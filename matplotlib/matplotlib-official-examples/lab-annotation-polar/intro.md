# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a polar graph and annotate it using Python Matplotlib library. A polar graph is a graph drawn using polar coordinates. It is useful for visualizing cyclic phenomena such as waves, seasons, and tides.

> You can write code in `annotation-polar.ipynb`.
