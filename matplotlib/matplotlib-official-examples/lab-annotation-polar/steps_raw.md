# Polar Annotation Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a polar graph and annotate it using Python Matplotlib library. A polar graph is a graph drawn using polar coordinates. It is useful for visualizing cyclic phenomena such as waves, seasons, and tides.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Libraries

To get started, we first need to import the necessary libraries. In this case, we need `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Create a Polar Graph

Next, we create a polar graph by defining the figure and specifying that it has a polar projection. We also define the radius and theta values to be used in plotting.

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='polar')
r = np.arange(0, 1, 0.001)
theta = 2 * 2*np.pi * r
line, = ax.plot(theta, r, color='#ee8d18', lw=3)
```

### Step 3: Add Annotation

We can add an annotation to the polar graph by specifying the location of the annotation. In this case, we choose a specific point on the graph and annotate it.

```python
ind = 800
thisr, thistheta = r[ind], theta[ind]
ax.plot([thistheta], [thisr], 'o')
ax.annotate('a polar annotation',
            xy=(thistheta, thisr),  # theta, radius
            xytext=(0.05, 0.05),    # fraction, fraction
            textcoords='figure fraction',
            arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05),
            horizontalalignment='left',
            verticalalignment='bottom',
            )
```

### Step 4: Display the Graph

We can now display the graph using `plt.show()`.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a polar graph and annotate it using Python Matplotlib library. We used `numpy` to define the radius and theta values and `plt.annotate()` to add an annotation to the graph. We also displayed the graph using `plt.show()`.
