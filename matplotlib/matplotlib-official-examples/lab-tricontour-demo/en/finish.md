# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create contour plots of unstructured triangular grids using `matplotlib` and `numpy`. We created a Delaunay triangulation of the points, masked off unwanted triangles, created a pcolor plot, a hatched contour plot, and a user-specified triangulation contour plot. We also learned how to add a colorbar and a legend to the plots.
