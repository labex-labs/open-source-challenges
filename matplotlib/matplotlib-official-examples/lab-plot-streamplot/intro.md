# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a streamplot using Matplotlib in Python. Streamplot is a 2D vector field that displays a set of streamlines. It is used to visualize fluid flow and other vector fields. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a streamplot with varying density, color, and line width along with controlling the starting points of streamlines.

> You can write code in `plot-streamplot.ipynb`.
