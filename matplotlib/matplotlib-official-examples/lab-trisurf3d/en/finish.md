# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to create a 3D surface with a triangular mesh using Python Matplotlib library. We have imported the necessary libraries, defined the variables for the radii and angles, created the radii and angles spaces, converted the polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, computed z to make the pringle surface, and created the 3D surface using the `plot_trisurf` function.
