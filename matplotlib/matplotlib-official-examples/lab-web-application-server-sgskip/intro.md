# Introduction

This tutorial lab will guide you through using Matplotlib in a Flask web application server. You will learn how to create figures using the `.Figure` constructor and save them to in-memory buffers, embed the resulting figures in HTML output, and run the Flask application using the `flask` command-line tool.

> You can write code in `web-application-server-sgskip.ipynb`.
