# Introduction

This tutorial lab will guide you through using Matplotlib in a Flask web application server. You will learn how to create figures using the `.Figure` constructor and save them to in-memory buffers, embed the resulting figures in HTML output, and run the Flask application using the `flask` command-line tool.

You can open the `web-application-server-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
