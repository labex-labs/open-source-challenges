# Summary

In this lab, we created a 3D box surface plot using Python and Matplotlib. We defined dimensions, created fake data, and plotted contour surfaces. We set limits of the plot, plotted edges, set labels and zticks, set zoom and angle view, and added a colorbar. This plot can be used to visualize 3D data and explore relationships between variables.
