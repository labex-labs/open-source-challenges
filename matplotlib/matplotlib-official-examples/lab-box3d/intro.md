# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a 3D box surface plot using Python and Matplotlib. We will define dimensions, create fake data, and plot contour surfaces. We will set limits of the plot, plot edges, set labels and zticks, set zoom and angle view, and add a colorbar.

> You can write code in `box3d.ipynb`.
