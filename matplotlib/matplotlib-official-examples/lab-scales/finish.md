# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to apply various scale transformations to axes using Matplotlib. We explored linear, logarithmic, symmetrical logarithmic, logit, custom, and Mercator transform scale transformations. By applying these scale transformations, we can better visualize data that contains very large or very small numbers, as well as data that contains both positive and negative values.
