# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. It allows users to create a wide variety of charts, plots, and graphs. One of the key features of Matplotlib is its ability to apply scale transformations to axes. This allows for greater flexibility in presenting data, especially when dealing with very large or very small numbers. In this lab, we will learn how to apply various scale transformations to axes using Matplotlib.
