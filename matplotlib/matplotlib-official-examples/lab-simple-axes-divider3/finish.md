# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Matplotlib Axes Divider to create custom layouts for subplots in a figure. We created a figure object and set up four axes objects, then used the axes divider to position the axes in a grid. We customized the limits and appearance of each axis and displayed the plot using the `show` method.
