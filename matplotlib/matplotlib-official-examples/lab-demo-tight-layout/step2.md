# Creating a Simple Plot

Now that we have imported Matplotlib, we can start creating visualizations. Let's start by creating a simple plot.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

Here, we are creating two lists `x` and `y` that contain the x and y values for our plot. We then use the `plot` function to create a line plot of `x` and `y`. Finally, we use the `show` function to display the plot.
