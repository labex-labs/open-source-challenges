# Customizing the Plot

Now that we have a basic plot, let's customize it.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

plt.plot(x, y, color='red', marker='o')
plt.title('My Plot')
plt.xlabel('X Axis Label')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis Label')
plt.show()
```

Here, we have added some customizations to our plot. We have changed the color of the line to red and added circular markers to each data point. We have also added a title and axis labels to our plot.
