# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to use Matplotlib to create visualizations in Python. We started by importing Matplotlib and creating a simple plot. We then customized our plot by changing the color and adding a title and axis labels. We also learned how to create multiple plots in the same figure and how to save our plots to a file.
