# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to customize the tick labels on a colorbar in Matplotlib. We first created a plot with a vertical colorbar and customized the tick labels using `set_yticklabels`. We then created a plot with a horizontal colorbar and customized the tick labels using `set_xticklabels`. Customizing the tick labels on a colorbar can help make your visualizations more informative and easier to read.
