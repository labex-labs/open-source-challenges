# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to plot a 3D surface using Matplotlib in Python. The 3D surface is colored with the coolwarm colormap and made opaque by using "antialiased=False". The tutorial also demonstrates using the `.LinearLocator` and custom formatting for the z axis tick labels.

> You can write code in `surface3d.ipynb`.
