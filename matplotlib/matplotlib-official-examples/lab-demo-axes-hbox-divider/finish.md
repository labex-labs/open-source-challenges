# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `HBoxDivider` and `VBoxDivider` classes in Matplotlib to create subplots. We saw how to adjust the axes' location so that they have equal heights or widths while maintaining their aspect ratios. These classes can be useful when we need to arrange multiple subplots in a single figure.
