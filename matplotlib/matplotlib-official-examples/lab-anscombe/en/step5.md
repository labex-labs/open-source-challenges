# Interpret the Results

The resulting visualization is a set of four subplots, each showing a different dataset. The x and y limits are the same for all subplots. Each subplot contains the x and y data points as well as a linear regression line. The text box in the lower right corner of each subplot shows some statistics about the data, including the mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient.
