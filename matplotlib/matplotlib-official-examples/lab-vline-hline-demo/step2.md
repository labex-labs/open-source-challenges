# Define Data

The next step is to define the data that we will be using in our plot. We will use NumPy's `arange` function to create an array of values from 0 to 5 with a step of 0.1. We will use this array as the x-axis. We will also define the y-axis by using the exponential function and sine function from NumPy.

```python
# Define the data
t = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.1)
s = np.exp(-t) + np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) + 1
```
