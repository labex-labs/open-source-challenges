# Import Libraries

We begin by importing the necessary libraries. We will use `multiprocessing` to handle the separate processes, `time` for the time delay, `numpy` to generate random data, and `matplotlib` for the plotting.

```python
import multiprocessing as mp
import time
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
