# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the `pcolormesh` function in the Matplotlib library. We covered the basic usage of `pcolormesh`, non-rectilinear pcolormesh, centered coordinates, and making levels using norms. These techniques can be used to generate different types of 2D image-style plots in Matplotlib.
