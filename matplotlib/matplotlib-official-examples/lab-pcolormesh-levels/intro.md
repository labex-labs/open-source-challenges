# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `pcolormesh` function in the Matplotlib library to generate 2D image-style plots. We will cover the basic usage of `pcolormesh`, non-rectilinear pcolormesh, centered coordinates, and making levels using norms.

You can open the `pcolormesh-levels.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
