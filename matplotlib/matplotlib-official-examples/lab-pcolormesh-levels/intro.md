# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `pcolormesh` function in the Matplotlib library to generate 2D image-style plots. We will cover the basic usage of `pcolormesh`, non-rectilinear pcolormesh, centered coordinates, and making levels using norms.

> You can write code in `pcolormesh-levels.ipynb`.
