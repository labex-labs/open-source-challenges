# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create and customize plots using Matplotlib. We covered how to create a figure and subplots, plot data, customize axis labels, add text to the plot, add gridlines, customize x-axis labels, add a horizontal line and title to the plot, and adjust the subplot positions. Matplotlib provides a wide range of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, making it a powerful library for data visualization.
