# Import Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries. We will be using Matplotlib, wxPython, and NumPy. Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python, wxPython is a GUI toolkit for Python, and NumPy is a library for numerical computing with Python.

```python
import wx
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.backends.backend_wxagg import FigureCanvasWxAgg as FigureCanvas
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
```
