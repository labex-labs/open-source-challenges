# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple GUI using Matplotlib in Python. Specifically, you will create a Fourier Demo that displays two waveforms in the frequency and time domains. You will be able to adjust the frequency and amplitude of the waveforms by clicking and dragging on the plot.

> You can open the `fourier-demo-wx-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

> Labby cannot automatically verify the answers because it cannot access the notebook.
