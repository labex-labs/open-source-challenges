# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to use GridHelperCurveLinear to define custom grids and ticklines by applying a transformation on the grid. We will use Python's Matplotlib library to create custom grids and ticklines.

> You can open the `demo-curvelinear-grid2.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
