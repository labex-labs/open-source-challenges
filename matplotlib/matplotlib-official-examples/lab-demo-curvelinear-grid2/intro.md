# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to use GridHelperCurveLinear to define custom grids and ticklines by applying a transformation on the grid. We will use Python's Matplotlib library to create custom grids and ticklines.

> You can write code in `demo-curvelinear-grid2.ipynb`.
