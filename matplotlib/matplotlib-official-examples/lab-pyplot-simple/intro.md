# Introduction

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. It also provides a procedural interface for non-interactive plotting.

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple plot using Matplotlib.
