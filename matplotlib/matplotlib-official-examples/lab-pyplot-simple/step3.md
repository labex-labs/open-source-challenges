# Customize the Plot

Matplotlib provides many options to customize the plot. You can change the color, linestyle, marker style, and many other options. Here is an example of how to change the color of the line to blue and the marker style to a plus sign:

```python
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], '+-b')
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
```
