# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a custom toolbar in a wxPython application using Matplotlib. We created a custom navigation toolbar with a control that adds text to the axes in a random location and color when clicked. We also defined a CanvasFrame class that created a figure, added a subplot, and displayed the plot on a canvas with the custom toolbar. Finally, we created the application and inserted the custom frame into the main window.
