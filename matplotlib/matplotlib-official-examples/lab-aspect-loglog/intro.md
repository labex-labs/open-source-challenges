# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create log-log plots using Matplotlib in Python. A log-log plot is a type of graph where both the x-axis and y-axis are logarithmically scaled. This allows us to visualize data that spans several orders of magnitude in a compact and informative way.

> You can write code in `aspect-loglog.ipynb`.
