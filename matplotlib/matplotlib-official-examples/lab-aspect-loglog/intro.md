# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create log-log plots using Matplotlib in Python. A log-log plot is a type of graph where both the x-axis and y-axis are logarithmically scaled. This allows us to visualize data that spans several orders of magnitude in a compact and informative way.

You can open the `aspect-loglog.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
