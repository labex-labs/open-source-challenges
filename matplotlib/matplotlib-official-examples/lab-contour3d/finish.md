# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib library in Python. We imported the necessary libraries, created a figure and subplot, got test data, created a contour plot, customized the plot, and displayed the plot. Contour plots are useful for visualizing the variation of a variable with respect to two other variables.
