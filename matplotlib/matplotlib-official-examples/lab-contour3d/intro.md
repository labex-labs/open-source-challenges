# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib library in Python. A contour plot is a graphical representation of a 3D surface in which contours are plotted on a 2D plane. Contour plots are useful to visualize the variation of a variable with respect to two other variables.
