# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to connect to keypress events in Matplotlib, which allows us to perform certain actions when a key is pressed. We will create a plot and set up a keypress event listener that will toggle the visibility of the x-label when the 'x' key is pressed.

> You can open the `keypress-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
