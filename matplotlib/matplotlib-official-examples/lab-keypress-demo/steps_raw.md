# Python Matplotlib Tutorial - Connecting to Keypress Events

## Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to connect to keypress events in Matplotlib, which allows us to perform certain actions when a key is pressed. We will create a plot and set up a keypress event listener that will toggle the visibility of the x-label when the 'x' key is pressed.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Libraries

We begin by importing the required libraries: `matplotlib.pyplot` and `numpy`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Define the Keypress Event Function

Next, we define a function `on_press` that will be called when a key is pressed. This function takes an `event` parameter which contains information about the key that was pressed. In this example, we will toggle the visibility of the x-label when the 'x' key is pressed.

```python
def on_press(event):
    print('press', event.key)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if event.key == 'x':
        visible = xl.get_visible()
        xl.set_visible(not visible)
        fig.canvas.draw()
```

### Step 3: Create the Plot and Connect the Keypress Event Listener

We create a simple plot using `np.random.rand()` to generate random data. Then, we set up the keypress event listener using `fig.canvas.mpl_connect()` and passing in the name of the event we want to listen for (`'key_press_event'`) and the function we want to call when the event occurs (`on_press`).

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

fig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_press)

ax.plot(np.random.rand(12), np.random.rand(12), 'go')
xl = ax.set_xlabel('easy come, easy go')
ax.set_title('Press a key')
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Run the Code

Save the code to a file and run it in a Python environment. A plot will be displayed with the x-label "easy come, easy go". When the 'x' key is pressed, the x-label will toggle between visible and invisible.

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to connect to keypress events in Matplotlib. We created a plot and set up a keypress event listener that toggles the visibility of the x-label when the 'x' key is pressed. This is just one example of what can be done with keypress events in Matplotlib.
