# Introduction

In this lab, we will demonstrate how to use filtering effects with Matplotlib's pie chart. We will use the pie chart drawing code borrowed from pie_demo.py and add filtering effects to the chart. The filtering effects are only effective if your SVG renderer supports it.

> You can open the `svg-filter-pie.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
