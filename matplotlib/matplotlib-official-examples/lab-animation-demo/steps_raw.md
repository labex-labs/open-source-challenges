# Matplotlib Animation Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through how to create a simple animation using `matplotlib.pyplot`. Animations can be useful for visualizing data that changes over time. In this tutorial, we will generate a random set of data and display it as an animation.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import necessary libraries

We need to import the necessary libraries to generate our animation. We will use `numpy` to generate random data and `matplotlib.pyplot` to display it as an animation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Generate random data

We will generate a 3D array of random data using `numpy.random.random()`. We will use a seed value to ensure that the same set of data is generated each time the code is run.

```python
np.random.seed(19680801)
data = np.random.random((50, 50, 50))
```

### Step 3: Create the animation

We will use a for loop to iterate through each frame of the animation. In each iteration, we will clear the axis, plot the current frame, set the title, and pause for a short amount of time to allow the animation to be displayed.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

for i, img in enumerate(data):
    ax.clear()
    ax.imshow(img)
    ax.set_title(f"frame {i}")
    plt.pause(0.1)
```

### Step 4: Display the animation

We can display the animation by running the code. The animation will be displayed in a new window.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple animation using `matplotlib.pyplot`. We generated a random set of data and displayed it as an animation using a for loop and the `plt.pause()` function. Animations can be a useful tool for visualizing data that changes over time.
