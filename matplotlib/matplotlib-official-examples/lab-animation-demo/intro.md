# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through how to create a simple animation using `matplotlib.pyplot`. Animations can be useful for visualizing data that changes over time. In this tutorial, we will generate a random set of data and display it as an animation.

> You can write code in `animation-demo.ipynb`.
