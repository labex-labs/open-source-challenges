# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to downsample data using Matplotlib in Python. Downsampling is the process of reducing the sample rate or sample size of a signal. We will use a class that will downsample the data and recompute when zoomed.

> You can open the `resample.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
