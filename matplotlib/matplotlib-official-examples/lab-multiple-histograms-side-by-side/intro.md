# Introduction

Histograms are a great way to visualize the distribution of a dataset, and Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python libraries for creating data visualizations. In this lab, we will use Matplotlib to create side-by-side histograms for multiple datasets.

> You can open the `multiple-histograms-side-by-side.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
