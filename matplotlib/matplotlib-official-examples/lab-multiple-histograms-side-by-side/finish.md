# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create side-by-side histograms for multiple datasets using Matplotlib. We computed the necessary quantities for plotting, and used the `barh` method to create horizontal bars for each histogram. With these skills, we can create informative visualizations of our data to gain insights and communicate our findings to others.
