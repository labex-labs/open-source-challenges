# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It provides a variety of plots and charts to visualize data in a meaningful way. In this lab, we will learn how to create inset axes within the main plot axes using `fig.add_axes` in Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `axes-demo.ipynb`.
