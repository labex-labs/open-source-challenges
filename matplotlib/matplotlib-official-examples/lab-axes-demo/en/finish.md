# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create inset axes within the main plot axes using `fig.add_axes` in Matplotlib. We generated data, set limits and labels, created two inset axes, and displayed the plot. This technique can be useful when we want to zoom in on a particular area of the plot or display additional information related to the data.
