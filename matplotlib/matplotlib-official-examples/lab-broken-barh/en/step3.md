# Interpret the plot

In this step, we will interpret the broken horizontal bar plot. The plot represents a race where two participants, Bill and Jim, started at different times. The y-axis represents the participants, and the x-axis represents the time since the start of the race in seconds. The blue and orange bars represent Bill's race, while the green, red, and light blue bars represent Jim's race. The annotation "race interrupted" indicates that the race was interrupted at 61 seconds.
