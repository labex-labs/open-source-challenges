# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to create a 3D plot using Python Matplotlib and how to change the projection type and focal length of the plot. The orthographic projection flattens the image while the perspective projection exaggerates the perspective and gives the image more apparent depth. The default focal length of 1 corresponds to a Field of View (FOV) of 90 deg.
