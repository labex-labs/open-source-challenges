# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an animated 3D random walk plot using Matplotlib library in Python. We will create a 3D plot and simulate a random walk with 40 particles that move randomly in 3D space.

> You can open the `random-walk.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
