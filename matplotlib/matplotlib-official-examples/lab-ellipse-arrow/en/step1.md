# Import Matplotlib and Create a Figure and Axis

First, you need to import Matplotlib and create a figure and axis. The figure and axis are the containers for your plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={"aspect": "equal"})
```
