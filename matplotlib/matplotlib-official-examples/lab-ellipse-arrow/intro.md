# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to draw an ellipse with an orientation arrow using Matplotlib. Ellipses are a type of shape that are commonly used in data visualization to represent data. By adding an orientation arrow to an ellipse, you can provide additional information about the direction of the data.

> You can open the `ellipse-arrow.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
