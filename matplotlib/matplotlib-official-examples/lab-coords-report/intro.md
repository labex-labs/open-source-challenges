This step-by-step lab will guide you through using Python's Matplotlib library to create visualizations. Matplotlib is a data visualization library that allows users to create a wide range of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, and histograms. In this lab, we will create a simple scatter plot using Matplotlib.
