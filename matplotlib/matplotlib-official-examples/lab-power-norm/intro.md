# Introduction

This lab explores various normalizations on a multivariate normal distribution using Python Matplotlib. In this lab, you will learn about linear normalization, power law normalization, and how to use Matplotlib to visualize the multivariate normal distribution.

> You can open the `power-norm.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
