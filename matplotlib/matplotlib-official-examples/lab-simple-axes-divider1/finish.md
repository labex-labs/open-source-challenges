# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a custom grid of axes with Matplotlib using the `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` module. We created two examples: one with fixed axes sizes and paddings, and another with scalable axes sizes and fixed paddings. We used the `Divider` class to divide the axes rectangle into a grid with sizes specified by `horiz * vert` and added axes to the figure using the `add_axes()` method and `new_locator()` method of the `Divider` class.
