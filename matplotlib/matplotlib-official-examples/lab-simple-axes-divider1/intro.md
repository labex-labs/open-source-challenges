# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a custom grid of axes with Matplotlib using the `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` module. We will create two examples: one with fixed axes sizes and paddings, and another with scalable axes sizes and fixed paddings.

> You can write code in `simple-axes-divider1.ipynb`.
