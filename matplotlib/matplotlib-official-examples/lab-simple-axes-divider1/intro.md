# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a custom grid of axes with Matplotlib using the `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` module. We will create two examples: one with fixed axes sizes and paddings, and another with scalable axes sizes and fixed paddings.

> You can open the `simple-axes-divider1.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
