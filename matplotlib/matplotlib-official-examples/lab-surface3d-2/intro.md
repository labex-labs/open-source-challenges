# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to create a 3D surface plot using Matplotlib in Python. The surface is plotted using a solid color. The lab will guide you through each step of the process, including creating the data, plotting the surface, and setting the aspect ratio.

> You can write code in `surface3d-2.ipynb`.
