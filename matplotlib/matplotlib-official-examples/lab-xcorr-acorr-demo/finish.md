# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use cross-correlation and auto-correlation plots in Python Matplotlib. We first imported the necessary libraries, then generated random data using NumPy. We then plotted the cross-correlation and auto-correlation of the data using the `xcorr` and `acorr` functions in Matplotlib. These tools are useful for measuring the similarity between two signals and are commonly used in signal processing, image analysis, and time series analysis.
