# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the use of cross-correlation and auto-correlation plots using the Python Matplotlib library. Cross-correlation and auto-correlation are mathematical tools used to measure the similarity between two signals. Cross-correlation measures the similarity between two different signals, while auto-correlation measures the similarity between a signal and a time-delayed version of itself. These tools are commonly used in signal processing, image analysis, and time series analysis.
