# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a 3D surface plot with a checkerboard pattern using Python Matplotlib library. We will create a 3D surface plot, customize the colors of the surface, and adjust the limits of the z-axis.

> You can open the `surface3d-3.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
