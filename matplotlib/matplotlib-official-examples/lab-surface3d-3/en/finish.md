# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to create a 3D surface plot with a checkerboard pattern using Python Matplotlib library. We have learned how to create data for the surface plot, create colors for the surface plot, create the surface plot, and customize the z-axis. This knowledge can be applied to create various types of 3D surface plots for different applications.
