# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a line plot on a polar axis using Python Matplotlib. We used the `numpy` library to generate the data and Matplotlib to plot the data. We also customized the plot by setting the maximum value for `r`, the tick values for `r`, the position of the radial labels, and adding a title and grid to the plot.
