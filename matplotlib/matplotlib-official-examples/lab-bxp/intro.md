Boxplot is a graphical representation of a group of data through their quartiles. It is used to show the distribution of data based on their five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create and customize a boxplot using Matplotlib library in Python.
