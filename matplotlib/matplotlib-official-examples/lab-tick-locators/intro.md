# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to define the position of ticks in a matplotlib plot using tick locators. Tick locators help to make plots more readable by defining the position of the ticks on the x and y-axes. We will cover different types of tick locators and how to implement them in a matplotlib plot.

> You can write code in `tick-locators.ipynb`.
