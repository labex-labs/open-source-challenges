# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to define the position of ticks in a matplotlib plot using tick locators. Tick locators help to make plots more readable by defining the position of the ticks on the x and y-axes. We will cover different types of tick locators and how to implement them in a matplotlib plot.

You can open the `tick-locators.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
