# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to create a gradient plot of an electrical dipole. You will learn how to create a triangulation, refine data, and compute the electrical field. Finally, you will plot the triangulation, the potential iso-contours, and the vector field.

> You can write code in `trigradient-demo.ipynb`.
