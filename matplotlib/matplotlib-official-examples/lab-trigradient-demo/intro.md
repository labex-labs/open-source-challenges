# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to create a gradient plot of an electrical dipole. You will learn how to create a triangulation, refine data, and compute the electrical field. Finally, you will plot the triangulation, the potential iso-contours, and the vector field.

> You can open the `trigradient-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
