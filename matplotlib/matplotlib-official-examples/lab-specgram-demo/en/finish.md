# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a spectrogram plot using Matplotlib. We generated a signal and used the `specgram` method from Matplotlib's `Axes` class to generate the spectrogram plot. We also customized the plot by adding titles, axis labels, and color maps. Spectrograms are useful for analyzing the frequency content of a signal over time and are commonly used in speech recognition, music analysis, and audio signal processing.
