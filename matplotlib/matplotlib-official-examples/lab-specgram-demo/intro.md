# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a spectrogram plot using Matplotlib. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. Spectrograms are commonly used to analyze the frequency content of a signal over time, such as in speech recognition, music analysis, and audio signal processing. We will use Python and Matplotlib to create a spectrogram plot of a signal.
