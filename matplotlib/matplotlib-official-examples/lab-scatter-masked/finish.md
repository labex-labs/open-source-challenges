# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a scatter plot with masked data points using the Python Matplotlib library. We also added a line to demarcate the masked regions. We started by importing the necessary libraries and setting the random seed. Next, we generated data for the scatter plot and masked the data points based on their distance from the origin. We then created a scatter plot of the masked data points and added a line to demarcate the masked regions. Finally, we displayed the scatter plot.
