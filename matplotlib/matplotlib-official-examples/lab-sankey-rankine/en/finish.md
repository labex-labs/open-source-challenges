# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a Sankey diagram using Python's Matplotlib library. We used the `Sankey` class from the `matplotlib.sankey` module to create the diagram, and we added labels and formatting to the diagram using the `text` attribute of each patch. Sankey diagrams are a useful tool for visualizing the flow of energy or materials through a complex system.
