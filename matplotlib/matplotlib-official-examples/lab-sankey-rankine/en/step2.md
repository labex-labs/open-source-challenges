# Define the Data

Next, we will define the data that we want to visualize using the Sankey diagram. In this example, we will use the data from Example 8.6 from Moran and Shapiro's "Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics". The data represents the flow of energy through a Rankine power cycle. We will define the energy flows as a list of values.

```python
Hdot = [260.431, 35.078, 180.794, 221.115, 22.700,
        142.361, 10.193, 10.210, 43.670, 44.312,
        68.631, 10.758, 10.758, 0.017, 0.642,
        232.121, 44.559, 100.613, 132.168]  # MW
```
