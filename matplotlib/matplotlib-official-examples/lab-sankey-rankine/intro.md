# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a Sankey diagram using Python's Matplotlib library. Sankey diagrams are a type of flow diagram that are commonly used to visualize the flow of energy or materials through a system. They are especially useful for analyzing complex systems with multiple inputs and outputs.
