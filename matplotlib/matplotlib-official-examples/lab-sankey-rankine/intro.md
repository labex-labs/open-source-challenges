# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a Sankey diagram using Python's Matplotlib library. Sankey diagrams are a type of flow diagram that are commonly used to visualize the flow of energy or materials through a system. They are especially useful for analyzing complex systems with multiple inputs and outputs.

You can open the `sankey-rankine.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
