# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, we will learn how to create an animated plot using Matplotlib. We will use the `FuncAnimation` class to create an animation of a decaying sine wave.

> You can write code in `animate-decay.ipynb`.
