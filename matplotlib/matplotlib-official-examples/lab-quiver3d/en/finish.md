# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a 3D quiver plot using Python Matplotlib. The `meshgrid` function was used to create a grid of points, and NumPy's trigonometric functions were used to define the direction of the arrows. The `quiver` function was then used to create the plot, and the `show` function was used to display it.
