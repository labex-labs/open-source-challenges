# Import Libraries and Set Up Plot

The first step is to import the necessary libraries and set up the plot. In this example, we will be using Matplotlib's `pyplot` module and its `3d` toolkit for creating the 3D plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

ax = plt.figure().add_subplot(projection='3d')
```
