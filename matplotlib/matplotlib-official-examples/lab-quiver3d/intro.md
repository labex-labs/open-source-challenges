# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D quiver plot using Python Matplotlib. A quiver plot displays a vector field as arrows. The arrows point in the direction of the vectors and their length represents the magnitude of the vectors.

> You can open the `quiver3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
