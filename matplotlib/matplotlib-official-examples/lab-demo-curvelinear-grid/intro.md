# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use `GridHelperCurveLinear` to create custom grid and tick lines in Matplotlib. We will also learn how to create a polar projection in a rectangular box.

> You can open the `demo-curvelinear-grid.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
