# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a stacked bar chart using the Matplotlib library in Python. We started by importing the necessary libraries, defined the data that we will use to create the chart, and then created a stacked bar chart using `matplotlib.pyplot.bar`. Finally, we displayed the chart using `matplotlib.pyplot.show()`.
