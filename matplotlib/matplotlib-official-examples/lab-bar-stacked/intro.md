# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a stacked bar chart using the Matplotlib library in Python. We will use penguin data to create a stacked bar chart that shows the number of penguins with above average body mass.

> You can open the `bar-stacked.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
