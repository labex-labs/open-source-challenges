# Introduction

The Matplotlib TextPath is a module that enables the creation of a path that outlines the characters of a text. The resulting path can be used for several purposes, such as a clip path for an image. In this lab, you will learn how to use the TextPath module to create and customize text paths for images.

You can open the `demo-text-path.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
