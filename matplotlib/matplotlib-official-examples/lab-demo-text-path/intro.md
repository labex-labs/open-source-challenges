# Introduction

The Matplotlib TextPath is a module that enables the creation of a path that outlines the characters of a text. The resulting path can be used for several purposes, such as a clip path for an image. In this lab, you will learn how to use the TextPath module to create and customize text paths for images.

> You can write code in `demo-text-path.ipynb`.
