# Summary

In this tutorial, we have learned how to annotate a plot using Matplotlib. We started by importing the necessary libraries and creating a plot. Then, we annotated the plot by adding an arrow pointing to a specific coordinate. Finally, we set the limits of the plot to ensure that the annotated point is visible.
