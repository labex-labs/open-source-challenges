# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will create a donut using Matplotlib's `~.path.Path` and `~.patches.PathPatch`. We will use the `make_circle()` function to create the circle and concatenate the inside and outside subpaths together to create the donut.

You can open the `donut.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
