# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a donut using Matplotlib's `~.path.Path` and `~.patches.PathPatch`. We used the `make_circle()` function to create the circle and concatenated the inside and outside subpaths together to create the donut. We also learned how to specify the type of each vertex and create a `Path` object using `mpath.Path`. Finally, we learned how to create a `PathPatch` object using `mpatches.PathPatch` and add it to the `Axes` object using `ax.add_patch()`.
