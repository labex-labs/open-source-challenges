# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create error bar plots in polar coordinates using Matplotlib. We created a figure and subplot, and used the `errorbar()` function to create radius and theta error bars. We also demonstrated how overlapping theta error bars can reduce readability, and how large radius error bars can lead to unwanted scale in the data.
