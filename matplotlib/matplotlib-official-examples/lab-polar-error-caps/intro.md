# Introduction

In data visualization, error bars are used to indicate the uncertainty or variability of data points. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python that provides built-in support for error bars. In this lab, we will learn how to create error bar plots in polar coordinates using Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `polar-error-caps.ipynb`.
