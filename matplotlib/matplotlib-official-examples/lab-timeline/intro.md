# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple timeline using Matplotlib release dates. A timeline is a graphical representation of a sequence of events in chronological order. Timelines can be created with a collection of dates and text. In this example, we will show how to create a simple timeline using the dates for recent releases of Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `timeline.ipynb`.
