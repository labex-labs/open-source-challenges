# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple timeline using Matplotlib release dates. A timeline is a graphical representation of a sequence of events in chronological order. Timelines can be created with a collection of dates and text. In this example, we will show how to create a simple timeline using the dates for recent releases of Matplotlib.

You can open the `timeline.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
