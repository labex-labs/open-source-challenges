# Creating a Stem Plot

Next, we will create a stem plot with some variation in levels as to distinguish even close-by events. We add markers on the baseline for visual emphasis on the one-dimensional nature of the timeline. For each event, we add a text label via `~.Axes.annotate`, which is offset in units of points from the tip of the event line. Here is the code for creating a stem plot:

```python
# Choose some nice levels
levels = np.tile([-5, 5, -3, 3, -1, 1],
                 int(np.ceil(len(dates)/6)))[:len(dates)]

# Create figure and plot a stem plot with the date
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8.8, 4), layout="constrained")
ax.set(title="Matplotlib release dates")

ax.vlines(dates, 0, levels, color="tab:red")  # The vertical stems.
ax.plot(dates, np.zeros_like(dates), "-o",
        color="k", markerfacecolor="w")  # Baseline and markers on it.

# annotate lines
for d, l, r in zip(dates, levels, names):
    ax.annotate(r, xy=(d, l),
                xytext=(-3, np.sign(l)*3), textcoords="offset points",
                horizontalalignment="right",
                verticalalignment="bottom" if l > 0 else "top")
```
