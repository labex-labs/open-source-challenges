# Introduction

Boxplots are a type of graph used to display the distribution of data based on five-number summary ("minimum", first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and "maximum"). They are commonly used in data analysis to identify and visualize outliers, as well as to compare the distribution of different groups of data. In this lab, you will learn how to create and customize boxplots in Python using the Matplotlib library.
