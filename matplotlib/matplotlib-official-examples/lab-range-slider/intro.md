# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to use the RangeSlider widget in Matplotlib to control the thresholding of an image. The purpose of thresholding is to convert a grayscale image into a binary image, where the pixels are either black or white. This is useful for image segmentation, where we want to extract certain features from the image.

> You can write code in `range-slider.ipynb`.
