# Summary

In this lab, we have demonstrated how to use the RangeSlider widget in Matplotlib to control the thresholding of an image. We have shown how to create a fake grayscale image, display it and its histogram, create a slider to adjust the threshold values, and update the image and histogram based on the slider values. This technique can be used for image segmentation and other applications where we need to extract certain features from an image.
