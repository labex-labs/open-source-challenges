# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to enable picking on the legend to toggle the original line on and off using Python Matplotlib. We created a figure and axes, prepared data, created lines and legend, mapped legend lines to original lines, defined the on pick event function, connected the on pick event function to the canvas, and showed the plot.
