# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to draw a font table of the first 255 characters of a font file using Matplotlib's `Axes.table`. We defined functions to print all the glyphs in a font file and to draw the font table. We also used `argparse` to parse the path to the font file from the command-line arguments.
