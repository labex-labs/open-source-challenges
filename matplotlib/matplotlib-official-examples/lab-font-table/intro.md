# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides font support through the FreeType library. In this lab, we will learn how to draw a font table of the first 255 characters of a given font using Matplotlib's `Axes.table`.

> You can write code in `font-table.ipynb`.
