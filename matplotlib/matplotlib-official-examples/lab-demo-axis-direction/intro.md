# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to change the axis direction in a Matplotlib plot using the `set_axis_direction()` method. This method allows you to change the direction of an axis to any of the four cardinal directions: top, bottom, left, or right.

> You can open the `demo-axis-direction.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
