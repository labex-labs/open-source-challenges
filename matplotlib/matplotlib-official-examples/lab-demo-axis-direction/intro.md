# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to change the axis direction in a Matplotlib plot using the `set_axis_direction()` method. This method allows you to change the direction of an axis to any of the four cardinal directions: top, bottom, left, or right.

> You can write code in `demo-axis-direction.ipynb`.
