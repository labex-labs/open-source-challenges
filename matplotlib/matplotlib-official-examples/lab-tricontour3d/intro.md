# Introduction

In this lab, we will create a triangular 3D contour plot using Matplotlib. This plot is useful for visualizing unstructured triangular grids. We will be using the same data as in the second plot of trisurf3d_2.

> You can open the `tricontour3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
