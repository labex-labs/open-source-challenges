# Introduction

In data visualization, it is important to have clear and properly aligned labels for the x and y axes. Matplotlib provides several functions to help align these labels properly. In this lab, we will use the `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` functions to align the labels in our plot.

> You can open the `align-labels-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
