# Introduction

This lab will guide you to create a figure that showcases the selected features of Matplotlib's math rendering engine. The figure will demonstrate how to write mathematical expressions with examples of subscripts, superscripts, fractions, binomials, stacked numbers, radicals, fonts, accents, Greek, Hebrew, delimiters, functions, and symbols.

> You can write code in `mathtext-examples.ipynb`.
