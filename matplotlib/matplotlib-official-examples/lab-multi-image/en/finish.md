# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a set of images with a single colormap, norm, and colorbar in Python's Matplotlib library. We generated data, set color scales, and updated images to respond to changes in the norm of other images. This is a useful technique for visualizing multiple sets of data with the same color scale and colormap.
