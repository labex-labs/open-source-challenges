# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of making a set of images with a single colormap, norm, and colorbar in Python's Matplotlib library. You will learn how to generate data, set color scales, and update images to respond to changes in the norm of other images.

> You can write code in `multi-image.ipynb`.
