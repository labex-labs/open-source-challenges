# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Matplotlib to compute the mean and standard deviation of 100 datasets and plot mu vs. sigma. We also added interactivity to the plot so that when a point is clicked, the raw data from the dataset that generated that point is displayed. This lab demonstrates the power and flexibility of Matplotlib for exploring and visualizing data.
