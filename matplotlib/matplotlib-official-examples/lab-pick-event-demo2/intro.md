# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Python's Matplotlib library to compute the mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) of 100 data sets and plot mu vs. sigma. We will also add interactivity to the plot so that when you click on one of the (mu, sigma) points, the raw data from the dataset that generated this point will be plotted.

> You can open the `pick-event-demo2.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
