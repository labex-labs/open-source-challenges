# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about the `zorder` attribute in Matplotlib and how to change the drawing order of artists. We also explored how to set the `zorder` for ticks and grid lines and create a custom order of elements. Understanding `zorder` is essential when creating complex visualizations with overlapping elements.
