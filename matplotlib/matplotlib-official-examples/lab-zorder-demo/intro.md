# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about the drawing order of artists in Matplotlib and how to adjust the order using the `zorder` attribute. We will also explore how to change the order for individual artists and the default value of `zorder` for different types of artists.

> You can write code in `zorder-demo.ipynb`.
