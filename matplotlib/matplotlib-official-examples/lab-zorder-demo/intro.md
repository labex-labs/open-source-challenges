# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about the drawing order of artists in Matplotlib and how to adjust the order using the `zorder` attribute. We will also explore how to change the order for individual artists and the default value of `zorder` for different types of artists.

You can open the `zorder-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
