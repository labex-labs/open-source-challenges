# Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to create tick labels from a list of values using Matplotlib. We first created a figure and axes object, then created the x and y data, and finally created a list of labels. We then created a formatting function that determines the tick label from the value at the tick and set the tick formatter and locator. Finally, we created the plot and displayed it.
