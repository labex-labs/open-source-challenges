# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to create tick labels from a list of values. When using `.Axes.set_xticks`, the tick labels are set on the currently chosen ticks. However, sometimes it is better to allow Matplotlib to dynamically choose the number of ticks and their spacing. In this case, you may want to determine the tick label from the value at the tick. This tutorial will show you how to do this.
