# Install Dependencies

Before we begin, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. In addition to Python 3, you will need to install the GTK4 and Matplotlib libraries. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it before installing the libraries.

```
pip install pygobject
pip install matplotlib
```
