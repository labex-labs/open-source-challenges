# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of embedding Matplotlib in GTK4, using Python. Matplotlib is a data visualization library that allows users to create a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. GTK4 is a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.

> You can write code in `embedding-in-gtk4-panzoom-sgskip.ipynb`.
