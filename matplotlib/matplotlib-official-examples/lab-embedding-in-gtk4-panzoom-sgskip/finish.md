# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to embed Matplotlib in a GTK4 window using Python. The steps included installing the necessary dependencies, importing the required libraries, creating a GTK4 application, creating a Matplotlib Figure, adding a canvas to the GTK4 window, adding a navigation toolbar to the GTK4 window, and displaying the GTK4 window. You should now be able to create your own Matplotlib plots in GTK4 windows.
