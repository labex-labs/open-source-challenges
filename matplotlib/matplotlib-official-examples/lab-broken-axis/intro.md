# Introduction

In data visualization, there are times when we have to deal with outliers that make it difficult to see the details of most of the data. In such cases, we can use a broken axis to zoom in on the majority of the data while still showing the outliers. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a broken axis plot using Matplotlib in Python.

You can open the `broken-axis.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
