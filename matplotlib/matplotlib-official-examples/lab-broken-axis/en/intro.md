# Introduction

In data visualization, there are times when we have to deal with outliers that make it difficult to see the details of most of the data. In such cases, we can use a broken axis to zoom in on the majority of the data while still showing the outliers. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a broken axis plot using Matplotlib in Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.
