# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a broken axis plot using Matplotlib in Python. We started by importing the necessary libraries and creating some random data with outliers. We then created two subplots, plotted the data on both subplots, and set the y-axis limits. We hid the spines between the subplots and adjusted the ticks on the x-axis. Finally, we created the cut-out slanted lines and showed the plot.
