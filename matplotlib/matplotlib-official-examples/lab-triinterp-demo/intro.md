# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Python's Matplotlib library to interpolate data from a triangular grid to a quad grid. We will start by creating a triangulation and then interpolate the data using linear and cubic methods. Finally, we will plot the results.

> You can write code in `triinterp-demo.ipynb`.
