# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Python's Matplotlib library to interpolate data from a triangular grid to a quad grid. We will start by creating a triangulation and then interpolate the data using linear and cubic methods. Finally, we will plot the results.

> You can open the `triinterp-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
