# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to use filters in Matplotlib to modify the rendering of Artists. You have modified images, lines, patches, and pies with different types of filters such as Gaussian, DropShadow, Light, and Grow. Now you can use these filters to enhance the appearance of your plots and make them more visually appealing.
