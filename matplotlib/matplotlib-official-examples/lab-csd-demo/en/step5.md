# Interpret Results

The resulting plot shows the CSD of the two signals. The x-axis represents the frequency and the y-axis represents the strength of the correlation between the two signals at that frequency. The plot shows a peak at 10 Hz, which is the frequency of the coherent part of the signals. This indicates that the two signals are strongly correlated at this frequency.
