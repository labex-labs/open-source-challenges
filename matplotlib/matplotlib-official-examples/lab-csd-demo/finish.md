# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to compute the Cross Spectral Density of two signals using Python's Matplotlib library. We generated two signals with a coherent part and a random part, plotted the signals, computed the CSD, and interpreted the results. The CSD is a useful tool for determining the correlation between two signals in the frequency domain.
