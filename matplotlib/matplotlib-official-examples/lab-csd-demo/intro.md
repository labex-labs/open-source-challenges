# Introduction

In signal processing, Cross Spectral Density (CSD) is a measure of the correlation between two signals in the frequency domain. It is used to determine how much two signals are related to each other in terms of their frequency content. In this lab, you will learn how to compute the CSD of two signals using Python's Matplotlib library.
