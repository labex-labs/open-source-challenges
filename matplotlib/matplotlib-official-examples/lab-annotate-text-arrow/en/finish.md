# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create an annotated scatter plot with a text arrow using Matplotlib in Python. We used the `ax.text()` function to add annotations and a text arrow to the plot, and the `ax.set_xlim()`, `ax.set_ylim()`, and `plt.show()` functions to set plot limits and show the plot.
