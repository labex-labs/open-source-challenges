# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the scroll event in Matplotlib to navigate through 2D slices of 3D data. We created a `IndexTracker` class to keep track of the current slice index and updated the plot accordingly. Finally, we created the plot and connected the scroll event to the figure canvas.
