# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a tooltip that will show up when hovering over a matplotlib patch. We created the tooltip in matplotlib and simply toggled its visibility on when hovering over the patch. We also added interactivity to the plot by creating a tooltip that will be toggled on and off when hovering over the patches.
