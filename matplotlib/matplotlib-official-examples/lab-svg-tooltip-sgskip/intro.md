# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create a tooltip that will show up when hovering over a matplotlib patch. We will create the tooltip in matplotlib and simply toggle its visibility on when hovering over the patch. This approach provides total control over the tooltip placement and appearance, at the expense of more code up front.
