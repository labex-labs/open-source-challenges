# Introduction

Error bars are used in graphs and charts to show the potential error or uncertainty in a measurement or data point. Python Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library that provides different types of error bar plots. In this lab, we will learn how to create error bar plots with upper and lower limits using Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `errorbar-limits.ipynb`.
