# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use `GridSpec` to generate subplots, control the relative sizes of subplots with _width_ratios_ and _height_ratios_, and the spacing around and between subplots using subplot params (_left_, _right_, _bottom_, _top_, _wspace_, and _hspace_).

> You can open the `demo-gridspec03.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
