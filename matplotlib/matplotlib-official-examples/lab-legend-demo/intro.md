# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create and customize legends in Matplotlib. Legends are used to explain the meaning of the elements in a chart, including lines, bars, and markers. We will demonstrate how to create legends for specific lines, complex labels, and more complex plots. Finally, we will show how to write custom classes to stylize legends.

> You can write code in `legend-demo.ipynb`.
