# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create and customize legends in Matplotlib. We demonstrated how to create legends for specific lines, complex labels, and more complex plots. We also showed how to write custom classes to stylize legends. Legends are an important part of any chart, and understanding how to create and customize them is essential for creating effective visualizations.
