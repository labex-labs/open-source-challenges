# Matplotlib Tutorial - Creating Text and Mathtext using Pyplot

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It provides a wide range of tools to create graphs and plots in Python. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create text and mathtext using pyplot.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

First, we need to import the required libraries. We will import `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Create Data

Next, we will create data for the plot. We will create a sine wave using `numpy` library.

```python
t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
```

### Step 3: Plot the Graph

Now, we will plot the graph using `plot()` method of `pyplot` library.

```python
plt.plot(t, s)
```

### Step 4: Add Text to the Graph

We can add text to the graph using `text()` method of `pyplot` library. We will add "Hello, world!" text at coordinates (0, -1).

```python
plt.text(0, -1, r'Hello, world!', fontsize=15)
```

### Step 5: Add Title, X-label, and Y-label

We can add title, X-label, and Y-label to the graph using `title()`, `xlabel()`, and `ylabel()` methods of `pyplot` library. We will add "Voltage vs Time" as the title, "Time [s]" as X-label, and "Voltage [mV]" as Y-label.

```python
plt.title(r'Voltage vs Time', fontsize=20)
plt.xlabel('Time [s]')
plt.ylabel('Voltage [mV]')
```

### Step 6: Show the Graph

Finally, we will show the graph using `show()` method of `pyplot` library.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create text and mathtext using pyplot. We learned how to add text to the graph, how to add title, X-label, and Y-label to the graph, and how to show the graph using pyplot.
