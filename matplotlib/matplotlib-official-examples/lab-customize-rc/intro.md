# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of customizing `.rcParams` on the fly using Python Matplotlib. You will learn how to define functions in a custom module that set the defaults for figures, and how to use these defaults to create different sets of defaults for figures, such as one set for publication and another set for interactive exploration.

> You can open the `customize-rc.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
