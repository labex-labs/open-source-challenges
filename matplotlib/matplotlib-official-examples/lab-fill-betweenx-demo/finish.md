# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the `fill_betweenx` function in Matplotlib to fill the area between two horizontal curves. We also learned how to create multiple subplots and use logical conditions and masked arrays to create different types of plots. By using the `fill_betweenx` function, we can create complex and customizable plots in Python.
