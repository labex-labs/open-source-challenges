# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python. It provides a wide variety of tools to create complex and customizable plots, charts, and graphs. One of the most useful tools provided by Matplotlib is the `fill_betweenx` function. This function is used to fill the area between two horizontal curves. In this tutorial, we will explore the `fill_betweenx` function and learn how to use it to create different types of plots.
