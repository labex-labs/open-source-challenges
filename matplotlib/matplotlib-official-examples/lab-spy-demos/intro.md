# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to plot sparsity patterns of arrays using Matplotlib. The sparsity pattern refers to the distribution of non-zero elements in an array. We will use the `spy` function in Matplotlib to plot the sparsity patterns.

You can open the `spy-demos.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
