# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to plot sparsity patterns of arrays using Matplotlib. The sparsity pattern refers to the distribution of non-zero elements in an array. We will use the `spy` function in Matplotlib to plot the sparsity patterns.

> You can write code in `spy-demos.ipynb`.
