# Summary

This tutorial showed how to plot arrows that behave differently when the data limits on a plot are changed. It covered three use cases for plotting arrows, depending on whether the head or anchor points need to be fixed in data or display space. These use cases can be useful for annotating plots and ensuring that the arrow stays in the correct position even if the plot is panned or scaled.
