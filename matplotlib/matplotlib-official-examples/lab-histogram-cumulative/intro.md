# Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to plot the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of a sample and the theoretical CDF using Matplotlib. ECDFs are also known as "non-exceedance" curves in engineering, where the y-value for a given x-value gives the probability that an observation from the sample is below that x-value. Conversely, the empirical _complementary_ cumulative distribution function (the ECCDF, or "exceedance" curve) shows the probability y that an observation from the sample is above a value x.
