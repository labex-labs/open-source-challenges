# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to plot the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) and the theoretical CDF using Matplotlib. We also learned how to plot the empirical complementary cumulative distribution function (ECCDF) and the reversed cumulative histogram. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should now be able to create your own cumulative distribution plots using Matplotlib.
