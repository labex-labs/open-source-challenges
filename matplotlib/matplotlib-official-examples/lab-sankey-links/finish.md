# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `Sankey` class from the `matplotlib.sankey` module to create a long chain of connections using Python Matplotlib. We defined the `side` and `corner` functions to generate the side chains and corner links respectively. We also added the first diagram, side chains, and corner links using the `Sankey` object and displayed the diagram using `plt.show()`.
