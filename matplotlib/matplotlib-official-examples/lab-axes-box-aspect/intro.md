# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating different plots using the `set_box_aspect()` method in Matplotlib. This method sets the aspect ratio between axes height and width in physical units, independent of data limits. It is useful for producing square plots, independent of the data it contains, or to have a usual plot with the same axes dimensions next to an image plot with fixed (data-)aspect.

> You can write code in `axes-box-aspect.ipynb`.
