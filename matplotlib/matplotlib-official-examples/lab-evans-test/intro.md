# Introduction

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. Matplotlib allows developers to create a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

In this lab, we will learn how to create custom units in Matplotlib and plot data using these custom units.
