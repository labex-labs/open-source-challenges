# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create custom units in Matplotlib using a custom unit class and a converter class. We then created two plots - one using custom units and the other using default units - to demonstrate the usage of these custom units. Custom units can be useful when dealing with complex data that requires custom scaling or tick formatting.
