# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to center labels between ticks in a Matplotlib plot using Python. We used financial data for Google's stock price to demonstrate this technique and followed the following steps:

1. Loaded the financial data
2. Created the plot
3. Set the major and minor locators and formatters
4. Removed the major tick labels and minor ticks
5. Aligned the minor tick labels to the center between the major ticks
6. Showed the plot.
