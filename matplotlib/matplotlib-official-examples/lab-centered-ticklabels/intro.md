# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to center labels between ticks in a Matplotlib plot using Python. By default, tick labels are aligned relative to their associated tick, but there is no direct way to center the labels between ticks. However, we can place a label on the minor ticks in between the major ticks and hide the major tick labels and minor ticks to fake this behavior. We will use financial data for Google's stock price to demonstrate this technique.
