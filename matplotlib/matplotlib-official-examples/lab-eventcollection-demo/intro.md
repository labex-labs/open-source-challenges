# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a line plot with data points using Matplotlib in Python. We will use the `EventCollection` class in Matplotlib to mark the locations of the x and y data points on the respective axes for each curve.

> You can open the `eventcollection-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
