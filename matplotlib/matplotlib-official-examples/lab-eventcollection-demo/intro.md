# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a line plot with data points using Matplotlib in Python. We will use the `EventCollection` class in Matplotlib to mark the locations of the x and y data points on the respective axes for each curve.

> You can write code in `eventcollection-demo.ipynb`.
