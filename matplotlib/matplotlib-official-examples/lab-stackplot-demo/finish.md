# Summary

Congratulations! You have learned how to create stackplots and streamgraphs using Matplotlib. Stackplots are useful for visualizing multiple datasets as vertically stacked areas, while streamgraphs are a variation of stackplots where the baseline is "wiggled" so that the areas of the plot are smoothed and flow into each other.
