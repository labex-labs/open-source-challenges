# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to create stackplots and streamgraphs. Stackplots are useful when you want to visualize multiple datasets as vertically stacked areas. Streamgraphs are a variation of stackplots where the baseline of the plot is not fixed at zero. Instead, the baseline is "wiggled" so that the areas of the plot are smoothed and flow into each other.

> You can write code in `stackplot-demo.ipynb`.
