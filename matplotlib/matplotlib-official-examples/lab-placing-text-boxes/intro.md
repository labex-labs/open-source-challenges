# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often necessary to add annotations to plots to provide additional information to the audience. One way to do this is by adding text boxes to a plot. In Matplotlib, it is possible to place text boxes in axes coordinates, so the text doesn't move around with changes in x or y limits. You can also use the `bbox` property of text to surround the text with a `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` instance.

In this lab, we will learn how to place text boxes in Matplotlib using Python.
