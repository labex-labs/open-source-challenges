# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often necessary to add annotations to plots to provide additional information to the audience. One way to do this is by adding text boxes to a plot. In Matplotlib, it is possible to place text boxes in axes coordinates, so the text doesn't move around with changes in x or y limits. You can also use the `bbox` property of text to surround the text with a `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` instance.

In this lab, we will learn how to place text boxes in Matplotlib using Python.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.
