# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to add text boxes to a plot in Matplotlib using Python. We used the `matplotlib.pyplot.text()` function to add the text box and specified the location of the box in axes coordinates. We also used the `bbox` property to add a rounded box around the text and set the box properties using a dictionary. This technique can be used to add annotations to plots and provide additional information to the audience.
