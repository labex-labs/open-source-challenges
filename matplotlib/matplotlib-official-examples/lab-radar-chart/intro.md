# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a radar chart using Python's Matplotlib library. A radar chart, also known as a spider or star chart, is a graphical method of displaying multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. It is often used to compare different products or solutions based on several factors.
