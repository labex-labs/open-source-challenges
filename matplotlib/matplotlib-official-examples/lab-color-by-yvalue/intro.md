# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python. It is a powerful tool for creating a wide range of graphs and charts. One of the features of Matplotlib is the ability to plot lines with different colors based on the y-value. This lab will demonstrate how to use masked arrays to plot a line with different colors by y-value.

You can open the `color-by-yvalue.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
