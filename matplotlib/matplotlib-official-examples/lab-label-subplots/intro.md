# Introduction

Matplotlib is a widely used data visualization library in Python. It provides a variety of tools to create different types of plots, including subplots. When creating subplots, it is often helpful to label each plot to make it easier for the reader to understand the information being presented. In this lab, we will learn how to label subplots using different methods provided by Matplotlib.

You can open the `label-subplots.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
