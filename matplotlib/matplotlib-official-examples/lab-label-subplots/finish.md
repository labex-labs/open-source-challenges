# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to label subplots in Matplotlib using different methods. We used `ax.text` to label inside the axes, `ax.set_title` to label with the title, and `plt.subplot_mosaic` to create the subplots. We also used `matplotlib.transforms` to transform the axes to align the labels. By labeling the subplots, we can make our plots more informative and easier to understand.
