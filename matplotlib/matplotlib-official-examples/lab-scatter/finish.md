# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a simple scatter plot using Python's Matplotlib library. We generated random data for the plot using the NumPy library, defined the size and color of the points, and created the plot using the `scatter` function from the Matplotlib library. Scatter plots are useful for identifying relationships between variables and for identifying outliers.
