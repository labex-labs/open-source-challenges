# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a simple scatter plot using Python's Matplotlib library. A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays values for two variables as a collection of points. Each point represents the values of the two variables, and the position of the point represents the values of the two variables. Scatter plots are useful for identifying relationships between variables and for identifying outliers.
