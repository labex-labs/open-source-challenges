# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use `pyplot` to manage figure windows, but modify the GUI by accessing the underlying GTK widgets. We will create a figure with two plots and add a button to the toolbar and a label to the canvas. We will also add functionality to display the coordinates of the cursor when it moves over the plots.

You can open the `pylab-with-gtk4-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
