# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use `pyplot` to manage figure windows, but modify the GUI by accessing the underlying GTK widgets. We created a figure with two plots, added a button to the toolbar, and a label to the canvas. We also added functionality to display the coordinates of the cursor when it moves over the plots. This lab provides a basic understanding of how to customize the GUI of a matplotlib figure using GTK4.
