# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create contour plots using Python Matplotlib. Contour plots are useful for visualizing three-dimensional data in two dimensions. In this tutorial, we will be illustrating simple contour plotting, contours on an image with a colorbar for the contours, and labeled contours.
