# Introduction

This lab is designed to teach you how to create an animated scatter plot using Python's Matplotlib library. We will cover everything from setting up the plot to saving the animation as a GIF. By the end of this lab, you will have a working animated scatter plot that you can use to visualize your data.

> You can open the `simple-scatter.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
