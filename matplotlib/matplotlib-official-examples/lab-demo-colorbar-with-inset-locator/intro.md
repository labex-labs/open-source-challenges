# Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to control the position, height, and width of colorbars using `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator.inset_axes`. This is useful when you want to add a colorbar to your plot but want to customize its size and position.

> You can write code in `demo-colorbar-with-inset-locator.ipynb`.
