# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator.inset_axes` to add a colorbar to a plot with customized size and position. The `inset_axes` function allows us to control the position, height, and width of the colorbar, making it easier to create professional-looking plots.
