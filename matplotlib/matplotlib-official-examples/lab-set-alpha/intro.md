# Introduction

This lab is about setting a color's alpha value using the Python Matplotlib library. Alpha value is a measure of transparency, where a value of 0 means completely transparent and a value of 1 means completely opaque. We will explore two ways to set alpha value in Matplotlib: using the `alpha` keyword argument and using the `(matplotlib_color, alpha)` color format.

## VM Tips

After the VM startup is done, click the top left corner to switch to the **Notebook** tab to access Jupyter Notebook for practice.

Sometimes, you may need to wait a few seconds for Jupyter Notebook to finish loading. The validation of operations cannot be automated because of limitations in Jupyter Notebook.

If you face issues during learning, feel free to ask Labby. Provide feedback after the session, and we will promptly resolve the problem for you.
