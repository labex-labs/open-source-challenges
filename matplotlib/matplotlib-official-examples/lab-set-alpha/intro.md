# Introduction

This lab is about setting a color's alpha value using the Python Matplotlib library. Alpha value is a measure of transparency, where a value of 0 means completely transparent and a value of 1 means completely opaque. We will explore two ways to set alpha value in Matplotlib: using the `alpha` keyword argument and using the `(matplotlib_color, alpha)` color format.

> You can write code in `set-alpha.ipynb`.
