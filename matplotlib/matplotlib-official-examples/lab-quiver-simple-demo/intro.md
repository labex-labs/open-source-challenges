# Introduction

This lab will guide you through how to create a quiver plot using Matplotlib in Python. A quiver plot displays vector fields as arrows. It is useful in visualizing fluid flows, electric and magnetic fields, and other types of vector fields.

> You can open the `quiver-simple-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
