# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a figure that contains both a 2D and a 3D plot using Matplotlib. The 2D plot will display a damped oscillation, while the 3D plot will display a sinusoidal wave.

You can open the `mixed-subplots.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
