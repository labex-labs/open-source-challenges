# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create filled contour plots with hatched patterns using Python's Matplotlib library. Contour plots are used to display three-dimensional data in two dimensions. They are particularly useful for visualizing data that has peaks and valleys, such as topographical data.

> You can write code in `contourf-hatching.ipynb`.
