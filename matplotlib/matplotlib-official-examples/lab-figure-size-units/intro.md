Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It is used to create high-quality graphs, charts, and figures for data analysis. In this lab, we will learn how to adjust figure size in different units using Matplotlib.

You can open the `figure-size-units.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
