# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to adjust figure size in different units using Matplotlib. We can specify the figure size in inches, centimeters, or pixels. By default, the figure size unit in Matplotlib is inches. We can convert centimeter-based and pixel values to inches to specify the figure size in these units.
