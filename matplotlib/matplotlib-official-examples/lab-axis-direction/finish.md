# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to set the axis direction in Matplotlib using the `mpl_toolkits.axisartist` module. We created a function to set up the axes for our plots and demonstrated different axis directions using multiple subplots. This is a useful tool for customizing plots and charts in Matplotlib.
