# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the stem plot function in Python's Matplotlib library. We first imported the necessary libraries, generated some data, and created a basic stem plot. We then customized the plot by adjusting the baseline and format properties. By following these steps, we can create informative and visually appealing stem plots for our data.
