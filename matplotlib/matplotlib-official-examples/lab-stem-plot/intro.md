# Introduction

The stem plot is a type of plot used in data visualization. It is used to plot vertical lines from a baseline to the y-coordinate and places a marker at the tip. In this lab, we will learn how to use the stem plot function in Python's Matplotlib library.

You can open the `stem-plot.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
