# Introduction

When plotting daily data such as financial time series, one often wants to leave out days on which there is no data, such as weekends. This allows the data to be plotted at regular intervals without extra spaces for the days with no data. In this lab, we will learn how to use an 'index formatter' to achieve the desired plot.

> You can write code in `date-index-formatter.ipynb`.
