# Introduction

In a Matplotlib plot, ticks are used to mark the position of data points on the axis. Major ticks are the larger ticks that denote the values of the data points and minor ticks are the smaller ticks that are placed between the major ticks. This tutorial shows how to use major and minor ticks in Matplotlib.
