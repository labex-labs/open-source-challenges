# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a polar plot with a legend using Python Matplotlib. Polar plots are used to plot data in polar coordinates, which is useful when working with directional data. Legends are used to explain the meaning of the different lines or markers on a plot.

> You can write code in `polar-legend.ipynb`.
