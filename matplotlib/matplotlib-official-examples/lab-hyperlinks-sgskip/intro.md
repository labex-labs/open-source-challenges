# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python data visualization library that enables users to create a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, you will learn how to add hyperlinks to your plots using Matplotlib. By the end of this lab, you will be able to add hyperlinks to scatter plots and images in Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `hyperlinks-sgskip.ipynb`.
