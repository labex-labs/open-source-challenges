# Matplotlib Tutorial: Adding Hyperlinks to Plots

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python data visualization library that enables users to create a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, you will learn how to add hyperlinks to your plots using Matplotlib. By the end of this lab, you will be able to add hyperlinks to scatter plots and images in Matplotlib.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

Before we get started, we need to import the necessary libraries for this lab. We will be using `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib.cm`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.cm as cm
```

### Step 2: Create a Scatter Plot with Hyperlinks

In this step, we will create a scatter plot and add hyperlinks to the markers. Here's the code to create the scatter plot:

```python
fig = plt.figure()
s = plt.scatter([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
```

To add hyperlinks, we need to use the `set_urls()` method of the scatter plot object. This method takes a list of URLs as its argument. Here's the updated code:

```python
s.set_urls(['https://www.bbc.com/news', 'https://www.google.com/', None])
```

The first two markers will have hyperlinks to `https://www.bbc.com/news` and `https://www.google.com/`, respectively. The third marker will not have a hyperlink. Finally, we can save the plot as an SVG file using `fig.savefig()`:

```python
fig.savefig('scatter.svg')
```

### Step 3: Create an Image with a Hyperlink

In this step, we will create an image and add a hyperlink to it. Here's the code to create the image:

```python
fig = plt.figure()
delta = 0.025
x = y = np.arange(-3.0, 3.0, delta)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z1 = np.exp(-X**2 - Y**2)
Z2 = np.exp(-(X - 1)**2 - (Y - 1)**2)
Z = (Z1 - Z2) * 2

im = plt.imshow(Z, interpolation='bilinear', cmap=cm.gray,
                origin='lower', extent=[-3, 3, -3, 3])
```

To add a hyperlink to the image, we need to use the `set_url()` method of the image object. This method takes a URL as its argument. Here's the updated code:

```python
im.set_url('https://www.google.com/')
```

The image will have a hyperlink to `https://www.google.com/`. Finally, we can save the plot as an SVG file using `fig.savefig()`:

```python
fig.savefig('image.svg')
```

### Step 4: Run the Code

Run the code in your Python environment. Two SVG files should be generated: `scatter.svg` and `image.svg`. Open these files and hover your mouse over the markers in the scatter plot and the image. You should see a tooltip with the hyperlink.

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to add hyperlinks to scatter plots and images in Matplotlib. You used the `set_urls()` method for scatter plots and the `set_url()` method for images. Adding hyperlinks to your plots can be useful when you want to provide additional information or resources to your audience.
