# Updating Histogram Colors

The histogram method returns (among other things) a `patches` object. This gives us access to the properties of the objects drawn. Using this, we can edit the histogram to our liking. Let's change the color of each bar based on its y value.

```python
# N is the count in each bin, bins is the lower-limit of the bin
N, bins, patches = axs[0].hist(dist1, bins=n_bins)

# We'll color code by height, but you could use any scalar
fracs = N / N.max()

# we need to normalize the data to 0..1 for the full range of the colormap
norm = colors.Normalize(fracs.min(), fracs.max())

# Now, we'll loop through our objects and set the color of each accordingly
for thisfrac, thispatch in zip(fracs, patches):
    color = plt.cm.viridis(norm(thisfrac))
    thispatch.set_facecolor(color)

# We can also normalize our inputs by the total number of counts
axs[1].hist(dist1, bins=n_bins, density=True)

# Now we format the y-axis to display percentage
axs[1].yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(xmax=1))

plt.show()
```
