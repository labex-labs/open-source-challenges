# Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python. It allows you to create a variety of plots, such as scatter plots, histograms, bar graphs, and more. The style sheets reference script demonstrates the different available style sheets on a common set of example plots. In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib style sheets to customize the appearance of your plots.
