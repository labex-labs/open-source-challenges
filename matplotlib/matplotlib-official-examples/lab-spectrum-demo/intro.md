# Introduction

This lab will guide you through generating and visualizing a sine signal with additive noise using Python's Matplotlib library. Specifically, we will create different spectrum representations of the signal using the fast Fourier transform (FFT).

> You can open the `spectrum-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
