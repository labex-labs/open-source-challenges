# Introduction

This lab will guide you through generating and visualizing a sine signal with additive noise using Python's Matplotlib library. Specifically, we will create different spectrum representations of the signal using the fast Fourier transform (FFT).

> You can write code in `spectrum-demo.ipynb`.
