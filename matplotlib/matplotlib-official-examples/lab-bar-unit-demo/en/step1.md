# Import the Necessary Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries. We will be using NumPy and Matplotlib to create the barchart. The `cm` and `inch` units are defined in the `basic_units.py` file, which is used to convert the units.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from basic_units import cm, inch
```
