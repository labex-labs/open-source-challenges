# Define the Data

The next step is to define the data that we will use to create the barchart. We will create two sets of data - one for tea and one for coffee. Each set will have five values, one for each group. The height of the cups will be represented in centimeters.

```python
N = 5
tea_means = [15*cm, 10*cm, 8*cm, 12*cm, 5*cm]
tea_std = [2*cm, 1*cm, 1*cm, 4*cm, 2*cm]
coffee_means = (14*cm, 19*cm, 7*cm, 5*cm, 10*cm)
coffee_std = (3*cm, 5*cm, 2*cm, 1*cm, 2*cm)
```
