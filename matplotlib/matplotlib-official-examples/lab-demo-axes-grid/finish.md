# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a grid of images using Matplotlib's `ImageGrid`. We explored different ways to add colorbars to the grid, including using a single colorbar for all images, giving each image its own colorbar, and giving each image its own colorbar with a different colorbar range.
