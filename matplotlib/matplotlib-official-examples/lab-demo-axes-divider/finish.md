# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to plot images using Matplotlib and how to manipulate the location of axes and colorbars. We covered different ways of creating images and colorbars and how to position them in the figure. With the knowledge gained from this lab, you will be able to create more complex visualizations and manipulate them to suit your needs.
