# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the usetex mode in Matplotlib to apply custom font effects to our plots. We defined a function to set the font, and then used the `fig.text()` method to add text to our plot. We also iterated over a list of fonts and corresponding text to demonstrate different font effects. By following these steps, you can create professional-looking plots with custom fonts in Matplotlib.
