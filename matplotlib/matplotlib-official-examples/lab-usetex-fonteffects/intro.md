# Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through how to apply font effects to your Matplotlib plots using the usetex mode. We will use a sample script that demonstrates font effects specified in the pdftex.map file. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create professional-looking plots with custom font effects.

> You can open the `usetex-fonteffects.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
