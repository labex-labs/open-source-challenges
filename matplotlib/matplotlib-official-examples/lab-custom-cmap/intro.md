# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides a wide range of colormaps that can be used to represent data. However, sometimes the default colormaps do not meet our needs. In such cases, we can create custom colormaps that suit our requirements. In this lab, we will learn how to create custom colormaps using Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `custom-cmap.ipynb`.
