# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create custom colormaps using Matplotlib. We saw how to create a colormap from a list of colors, create a custom colormap using a dictionary, register the custom colormap, and use the custom colormap in our visualizations. By creating custom colormaps, we can represent data in a way that is more visually appealing and informative.
