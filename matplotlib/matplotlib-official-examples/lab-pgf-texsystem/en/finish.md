# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a plot with custom fonts using the Python Matplotlib library. You used the `pgf.texsystem` parameter to set the font family of your plot and the `ax.text()` function to add text with different font families. You also learned how to adjust the layout of your plot and save it to a file.
