# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a plot with custom fonts using the Python Matplotlib library. You will be introduced to the `pgf.texsystem` parameter that allows you to use LaTeX to customize the font family of your plot.

> You can open the `pgf-texsystem.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
