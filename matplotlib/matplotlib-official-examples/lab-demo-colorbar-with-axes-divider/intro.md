# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. In this lab, we will learn how to add a colorbar to a plot in Matplotlib. Colorbars are useful for indicating the range of values that a colormap represents.

> You can write code in `demo-colorbar-with-axes-divider.ipynb`.
