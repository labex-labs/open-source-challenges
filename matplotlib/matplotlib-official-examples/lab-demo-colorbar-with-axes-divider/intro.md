# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. In this lab, we will learn how to add a colorbar to a plot in Matplotlib. Colorbars are useful for indicating the range of values that a colormap represents.

> You can open the `demo-colorbar-with-axes-divider.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
