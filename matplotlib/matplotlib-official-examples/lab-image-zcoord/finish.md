# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to modify the coordinate formatter in Matplotlib to report the image "z" value of the nearest pixel given x and y. We also learned how to create a plot of a random matrix using `imshow` method and customize the `~.axes.Axes.format_coord` function to modify the coordinate formatter.
