# Introduction

Matplotlib is a library used for data visualization in Python. It provides a wide range of tools for creating various types of plots, graphs, and charts. One of the useful features of Matplotlib is the ability to customize the coordinate formatter. In this lab, we will go through the steps of modifying the coordinate formatter in Matplotlib to report the image "z" value of the nearest pixel given x and y.

> You can write code in `image-zcoord.ipynb`.
