# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to align text in Matplotlib. We used the `text()` function to add text to a rectangle and set the horizontal and vertical alignment using the `horizontalalignment` and `verticalalignment` parameters respectively. We also customized the plot by adding axis labels and removing the axis lines.
