# Define the contour lines and polygons

The next step is to define the contour lines and polygons. In this example, we have lines and filled contours between two levels.

```python
# Contour lines for each level are a list/tuple of polygons.
lines0 = [[[0, 0], [0, 4]]]
lines1 = [[[2, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]]
lines2 = [[[3, 0], [3, 2]], [[3, 3], [3, 4]]]  # Note two lines.

# Filled contours between two levels are also a list/tuple of polygons.
# Points can be ordered clockwise or anticlockwise.
filled01 = [[[0, 0], [0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 2], [2, 0]]]
filled12 = [[[2, 0], [3, 0], [3, 2], [1, 3], [1, 2]],   # Note two polygons.
            [[1, 4], [3, 4], [3, 3]]]
```
