# Introduction

This lab will guide you on how to display your own contour lines and polygons using ContourSet in Matplotlib. Contour lines for each level are a list/tuple of polygons. Filled contours between two levels are also a list/tuple of polygons. Points can be ordered clockwise or anticlockwise.

> You can write code in `contour-manual.ipynb`.
