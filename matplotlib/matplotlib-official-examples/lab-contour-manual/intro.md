# Introduction

This lab will guide you on how to display your own contour lines and polygons using ContourSet in Matplotlib. Contour lines for each level are a list/tuple of polygons. Filled contours between two levels are also a list/tuple of polygons. Points can be ordered clockwise or anticlockwise.

> You can open the `contour-manual.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
