Matplotlib is a data visualization library that provides various tools to create 2D and 3D plots. It is built on top of the NumPy library and its main purpose is to visualize data in a simple and effective way. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create two different types of plots using the xkcd style from the XKCD webcomic.
