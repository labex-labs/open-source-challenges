# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create two different types of plots using the xkcd style from the XKCD webcomic. We first created an xkcd-style plot that shows the relationship between time and overall health. We then created a bar chart with the XKCD style that is based on the "The Data So Far" comic from XKCD. By using the xkcd style, we can create fun and engaging visualizations that are sure to capture the attention of our audience.
