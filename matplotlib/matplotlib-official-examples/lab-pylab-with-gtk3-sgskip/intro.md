# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the Matplotlib library to create and modify figure windows. We will also explore how to customize the GUI by accessing the underlying GTK widgets.

> You can open the `pylab-with-gtk3-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
