# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Matplotlib to create and modify figure windows. We also explored how to customize the GUI by accessing the underlying GTK widgets. We added a button to the toolbar and a label to the vbox, and updated the label text on mouse movement. We also plotted two lines on an axis and added a legend to distinguish them.
