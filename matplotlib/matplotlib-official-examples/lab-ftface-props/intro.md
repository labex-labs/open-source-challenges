In this lab, you will learn about the attributes of an `.FT2Font` object that describe global font properties. You will also learn how to use individual character metrics using the `.Glyph` object, as returned by `.load_char`.

> You can open the `ftface-props.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
