# Summary

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a date demo convert graph using Matplotlib. We covered importing the necessary libraries, defining the dates and y values, creating the graph, formatting the x-axis, and displaying the graph. With this knowledge, you can start creating your own custom graphs and charts using Matplotlib.
