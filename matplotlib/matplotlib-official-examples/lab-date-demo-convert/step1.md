# Import the necessary libraries

Before we can start creating the graph, we need to import the required libraries, which are Matplotlib, NumPy, and datetime. Copy and paste the following code:

```python
import datetime
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.dates import DateFormatter, DayLocator, HourLocator, drange
```
