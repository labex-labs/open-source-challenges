# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to map colormaps onto data in non-linear ways. We will demonstrate the use of `norm` to create logarithmic, power-law, symmetric logarithmic, and custom normalizations. We will also learn how to use `BoundaryNorm` to provide boundaries for colors.

> You can open the `colormap-normalizations.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
