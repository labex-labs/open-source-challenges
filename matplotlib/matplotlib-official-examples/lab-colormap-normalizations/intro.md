# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to map colormaps onto data in non-linear ways. We will demonstrate the use of `norm` to create logarithmic, power-law, symmetric logarithmic, and custom normalizations. We will also learn how to use `BoundaryNorm` to provide boundaries for colors.

> You can write code in `colormap-normalizations.ipynb`.
