# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a graph of multiple time series that demonstrates custom styling of plot frame, tick lines, tick labels, and line graph properties using Matplotlib. You also learned how to plot each stock separately with its own color, set the limits of the x-axis and y-axis, and add title and grid.
