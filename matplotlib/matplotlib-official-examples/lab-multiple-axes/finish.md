# Summary

This step-by-step lab demonstrated how to create an animation with multiple subplots using Matplotlib in Python. The example showed how to animate a circle and a sine curve across two different subplots. The steps included importing libraries, creating the figure and subplots, drawing the circle and initial point, drawing the sine curve, drawing the connection line, defining the animation function, creating the animation object, and showing the animation.
