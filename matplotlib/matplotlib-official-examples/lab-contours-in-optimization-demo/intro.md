# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. You will learn how to generate curves with larger values and how to use `~matplotlib.patheffects.TickedStroke` to distinguish between the valid and invalid sides of the constraint boundaries.

> You can open the `contours-in-optimization-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

> Labby cannot automatically verify the answers because it cannot access the notebook.
