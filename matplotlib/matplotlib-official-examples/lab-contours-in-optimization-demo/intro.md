# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. You will learn how to generate curves with larger values and how to use `~matplotlib.patheffects.TickedStroke` to distinguish between the valid and invalid sides of the constraint boundaries.

> You can write code in `contours-in-optimization-demo.ipynb`.
