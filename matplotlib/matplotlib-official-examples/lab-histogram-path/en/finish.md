# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Matplotlib to build histograms using rectangles and PolyCollections. We used numpy to generate random data, and then used Matplotlib to visualize the data as a histogram. We also learned how to draw histograms using a PathCollection, which is a faster method than using lots of Rectangle instances.
