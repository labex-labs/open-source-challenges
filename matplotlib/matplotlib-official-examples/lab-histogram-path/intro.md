# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to build histograms using rectangles and PolyCollections. We will use numpy to generate random data, and then use Matplotlib to visualize the data as a histogram. This lab assumes that you have a basic understanding of Python and Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `histogram-path.ipynb`.
