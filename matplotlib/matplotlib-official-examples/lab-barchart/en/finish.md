# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a grouped bar chart and how to annotate bars with labels using Python Matplotlib. We used data from the Palmer Penguins dataset to create a chart that displays penguin attributes by species. We also learned how to customize the chart by adding labels, a title, and adjusting the x-axis tick labels and legend.
