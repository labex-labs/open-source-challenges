# Introduction

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide on how to create an oscilloscope using Python's Matplotlib library. An oscilloscope is a device used to measure and display voltage signals over time. In this tutorial, we will use Matplotlib's animation module to create a real-time display of a voltage signal.
