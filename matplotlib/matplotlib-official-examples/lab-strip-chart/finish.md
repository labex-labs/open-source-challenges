# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use Matplotlib to create an oscilloscope that displays voltage signals over time. We defined a Scope class to hold the data and methods needed for the oscilloscope, created an update method to update the plot, and used the emitter function to generate the data. Finally, we set up the plot and passed the update and emitter functions to the FuncAnimation method to create the animation.
