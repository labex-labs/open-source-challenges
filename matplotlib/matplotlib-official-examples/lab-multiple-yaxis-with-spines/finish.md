# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a graph with multiple y-axes using Matplotlib. We created a figure and axes object, added a twin y-axis, set the position of the twin y-axis, added data to the plot, set the limits and labels for the axes, set the tick colors, added a legend to the plot, and displayed the plot. This technique can be useful when comparing variables with different units of measurement on the same graph.
