# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often necessary to plot multiple variables with different units of measurement on the same graph. One common method to achieve this is by using multiple y-axes, where each y-axis corresponds to a different variable. In this lab, we will learn how to create a graph with multiple y-axes using Matplotlib.
