# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Matplotlib to create topographic hillshading plots using varying blend modes and vertical exaggeration. The purpose of hillshading is for visual purposes to create a 3D-like effect on 2D maps. In this lab, we will learn how to change the blend modes and vertical exaggeration to achieve different visual effects.
