# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, we will learn how to use the 'dark_background' style sheet in Matplotlib to create plots with a dark background. The dark background style sheet is particularly useful for displaying visualizations that are easy on the eyes in low-light environments.

> You can write code in `dark-background.ipynb`.
