# Python Matplotlib Lab: Using the 'dark_background' Style Sheet

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, we will learn how to use the 'dark_background' style sheet in Matplotlib to create plots with a dark background. The dark background style sheet is particularly useful for displaying visualizations that are easy on the eyes in low-light environments.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

The first step is to import the required libraries. We will be using the Matplotlib library to create our visualizations and the NumPy library to generate some sample data.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Set the 'dark_background' Style Sheet

The next step is to set the 'dark_background' style sheet using the `plt.style.use()` function. This will apply the dark background style to all plots that we create from this point onwards.

```python
plt.style.use('dark_background')
```

### Step 3: Create Sample Data

In this step, we will generate some sample data to plot. We will create a sine wave with a wavelength of 6 units and plot it over the x-axis.

```python
L = 6
x = np.linspace(0, L)
```

### Step 4: Plot the Data

In this step, we will plot the sample data that we generated in the previous step. We will use a `for` loop to plot multiple sine waves with different phases.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ncolors = len(plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'])
shift = np.linspace(0, L, ncolors, endpoint=False)

for s in shift:
    # Plot the sine wave with a phase shift of s
    ax.plot(x, np.sin(x + s), 'o-')

ax.set_xlabel('x-axis')
ax.set_ylabel('y-axis')
ax.set_title("'dark_background' style sheet")

plt.show()
```

### Step 5: Interpret the Plot

The plot that we created in the previous step is a sine wave with a dark background. The `for` loop plots multiple sine waves with different phases, which are shifted along the x-axis. The x-axis represents the values of the sine wave, while the y-axis represents the amplitude of the sine wave. The `set_xlabel()`, `set_ylabel()`, and `set_title()` functions are used to label the x-axis, y-axis, and title of the plot, respectively.

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the 'dark_background' style sheet in Matplotlib to create plots with a dark background. We also learned how to generate sample data using the NumPy library and plot the data using the Matplotlib library. We hope that this lab has provided you with a good understanding of how to use the 'dark_background' style sheet in Matplotlib and how to create visually appealing plots.
