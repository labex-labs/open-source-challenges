# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the 'dark_background' style sheet in Matplotlib to create plots with a dark background. We also learned how to generate sample data using the NumPy library and plot the data using the Matplotlib library. We hope that this lab has provided you with a good understanding of how to use the 'dark_background' style sheet in Matplotlib and how to create visually appealing plots.
