# Interpret the Plot

The plot that we created in the previous step is a sine wave with a dark background. The `for` loop plots multiple sine waves with different phases, which are shifted along the x-axis. The x-axis represents the values of the sine wave, while the y-axis represents the amplitude of the sine wave. The `set_xlabel()`, `set_ylabel()`, and `set_title()` functions are used to label the x-axis, y-axis, and title of the plot, respectively.
