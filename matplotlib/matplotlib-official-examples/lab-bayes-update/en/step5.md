# Interpret Results

The animation shows how the beta distribution is updated as new data is observed. The black dashed line represents the true probability of success (i.e., the probability of the coin landing heads up). As the animation progresses, we see that the beta distribution starts out with a peak at the prior probability of success (0.7) and gradually shifts towards the true probability of success as more data is observed.
