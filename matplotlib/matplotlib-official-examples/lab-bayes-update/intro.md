# Introduction

Bayesian updating is a statistical approach that allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis as new data becomes available. In this lab, we will use Matplotlib to create an animation that shows how Bayesian updating works. Specifically, we will simulate a coin toss experiment and use Bayesian updating to estimate the probability of the coin landing heads up.
