# Import Required Libraries

We begin by importing the libraries we will use in the lab. Specifically, we will use `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization, `numpy` for numerical computing, and `math` for mathematical functions.

```python
import math

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
