# Summary

In this lab, we used Matplotlib to create an animation that demonstrates Bayesian updating. We defined a function to calculate the beta distribution PDF and a class to update the beta distribution as new data is observed. We then used Matplotlib's `FuncAnimation` class to create the animation and interpret the results.
