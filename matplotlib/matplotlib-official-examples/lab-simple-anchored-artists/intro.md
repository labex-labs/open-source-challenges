# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the anchored helper classes found in Matplotlib's offsetbox and mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1. You will create a figure that contains text boxes, a circle, and a size bar using these classes.

You can open the `simple-anchored-artists.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
