# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create histograms using Matplotlib. We explored different customization options, including changing the color, transparency, and edge color of the bars, plotting multiple histograms on the same plot, stacking histograms, and plotting step histograms. These tools can help us to better understand the distribution of our data.
