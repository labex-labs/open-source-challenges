# Define Success Symbols

In this step, you will define the three success symbols that will be used to represent the success of a baseball throw. Specifically, you will define a smiley face for a successful throw, a neutral face for a partially successful throw, and a sad face for an unsuccessful throw.

```python
SUCCESS_SYMBOLS = [
    TextPath((0, 0), "â˜¹"),
    TextPath((0, 0), "ðŸ˜’"),
    TextPath((0, 0), "â˜º"),
]
```
