# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use different properties of markers to plot multivariate datasets using Python's Matplotlib library. Specifically, you will learn how to represent a successful baseball throw as a smiley face with marker size mapped to the skill of thrower, marker rotation to the take-off angle, and thrust to the marker color.

> You can write code in `multivariate-marker-plot.ipynb`.
