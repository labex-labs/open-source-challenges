# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use different properties of markers to plot multivariate datasets using Python's Matplotlib library. Specifically, you will learn how to represent a successful baseball throw as a smiley face with marker size mapped to the skill of thrower, marker rotation to the take-off angle, and thrust to the marker color.

You can open the `multivariate-marker-plot.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
