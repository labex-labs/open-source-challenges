# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use different properties of markers to plot multivariate datasets using Python's Matplotlib library. Specifically, you learned how to represent a successful baseball throw as a smiley face with marker size mapped to the skill of thrower, marker rotation to the take-off angle, and thrust to the marker color. By following the steps outlined in this lab, you can create similar plots for your own multivariate datasets.
