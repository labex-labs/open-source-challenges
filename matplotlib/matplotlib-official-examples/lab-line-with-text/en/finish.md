# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to override basic methods so an artist can contain another artist in Python Matplotlib. We created a custom class called `MyLine` which inherited from `lines.Line2D` and contained a `mtext.Text` instance to label it. We then added the line to an axis object and displayed the plot.
