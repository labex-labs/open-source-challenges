# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a color demo chart using Python's Matplotlib library. Matplotlib provides a variety of ways to specify colors, which can be used in charts, graphs, and other visualizations. We will explore these different ways of specifying colors and use them to create a chart showing voltage vs. time.

> You can open the `color-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
