# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a color demo chart using Python's Matplotlib library. We explored several ways to specify colors and used them to create a chart showing voltage vs. time. We hope that this tutorial has been helpful in learning how to use Matplotlib to create charts and visualizations.
