# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the "grayscale" style sheet in Matplotlib to create plots with all colors in grayscale. We also learned how to create subplots, plot examples, and display the plot. Style sheets are an excellent way to customize the look of your plots, and Matplotlib provides many built-in style sheets to choose from.
