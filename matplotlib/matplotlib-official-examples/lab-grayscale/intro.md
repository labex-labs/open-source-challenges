# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python used to create a variety of charts, graphs, and plots. It provides a wide range of customization options to create attractive visualizations. One of these options is style sheets. A style sheet is a collection of settings that define the look of a plot. In this lab, we will explore the "grayscale" style sheet, which changes all colors to grayscale.
