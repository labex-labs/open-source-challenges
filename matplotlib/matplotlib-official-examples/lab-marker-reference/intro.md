# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular Python library used to create visualizations, including charts, graphs, and plots. One of the key components of Matplotlib is markers, which are used to represent data points on a plot. Markers come in various shapes, sizes, and styles, and can be customized to fit a specific data set. In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib markers to create custom visualizations that effectively communicate your data.
