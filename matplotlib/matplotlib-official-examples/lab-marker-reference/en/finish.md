# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use Matplotlib markers to create custom visualizations. Specifically, you learned how to create unfilled and filled markers, marker fill styles, markers created from TeX symbols, markers created from paths, advanced marker modifications with transform, and how to set marker cap style and join style. By using these techniques, you can create effective visualizations that communicate your data with clarity and precision.
