# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create wind barb plots using Python Matplotlib. We started by importing the necessary libraries and creating the data for the plot. We then created a basic wind barb plot and customized it by changing the parameters. Finally, we learned how to create a masked wind barb plot using a masked array.
