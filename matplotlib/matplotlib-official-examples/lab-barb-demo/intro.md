# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create wind barb plots using Python Matplotlib. Wind barbs are a graphical representation of wind speed and direction using a combination of flags, lines, and dots. The length of the line represents the wind speed, while the orientation of the flags and dots represent the wind direction.

> You can write code in `barb-demo.ipynb`.
