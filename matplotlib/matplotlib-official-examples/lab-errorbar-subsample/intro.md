# Introduction

In data visualization, it is sometimes useful to plot error bars to show the uncertainty or variability of the data. However, if there are many data points with similar errors, the plot can become cluttered and difficult to interpret. In such cases, we can use errorbar subsampling, which allows us to draw error bars only on a subset of data points. In this tutorial, we will use Matplotlib's `errorbar` function to demonstrate how to apply errorbar subsampling to our data.
