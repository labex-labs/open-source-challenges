# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to customize dashed line styles in Matplotlib. We covered how to modify the dash sequence using `.Line2D.set_dashes()`, configure the dash style using a `property_cycle`, and set other attributes of the dash using relevant methods like `~.Line2D.set_dash_capstyle()`, `~.Line2D.set_dash_joinstyle()`, and `~.Line2D.set_gapcolor()`. By following these steps, you can create customized dashed line styles for your plots in Matplotlib.
