# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create violin plots using Matplotlib library in Python. Violin plots are used to visualize the distribution of a dataset. These plots are similar to box plots, but instead of showing only the summary statistics, violin plots show the full distribution of the data.

We will use a sample dataset to create violin plots and modify various parameters to observe changes in the plot.

You can open the `violinplot.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
