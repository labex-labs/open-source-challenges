# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create violin plots using Matplotlib library in Python. We created custom violin plots by modifying various parameters such as number of points, bandwidth of KDE, and quantiles. We also learned how to customize the appearance of the plot by removing y-axis labels and adding a title to the plot.
