# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to adjust the spacing of margins and subplots using `pyplot.subplots_adjust` in Python Matplotlib. This can be useful to improve the layout and aesthetics of our plots.

You can open the `subplots-adjust.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
