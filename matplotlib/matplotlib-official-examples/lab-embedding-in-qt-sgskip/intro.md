# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to embed Matplotlib canvases in a simple Qt application using any Qt binding (PyQt6, PySide6, PyQt5, PySide2). This program will work equally well using any Qt binding and can be selected by setting the `QT_API` environment variable to the binding name or by first importing it.

> You can write code in `embedding-in-qt-sgskip.ipynb`.
