# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple menu using Matplotlib. The menu will contain a list of items, each of which can be selected by the user. The selected item will then trigger a callback function that will perform some action.

You can open the `menu.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
