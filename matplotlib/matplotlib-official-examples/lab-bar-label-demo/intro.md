# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `bar_label` helper function in Matplotlib to create labeled bar charts. We will cover various scenarios such as labeling horizontal and vertical bar charts, using different label formats, and customizing label appearance.

You can open the `bar-label-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
