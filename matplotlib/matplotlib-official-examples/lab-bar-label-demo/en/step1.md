# Import Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries, including `numpy` and `matplotlib`. We will also use the `random` module from `numpy` to generate some random data.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)
```
