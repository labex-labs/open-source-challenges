# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often useful to create multiple plots that share a common axis. This can be achieved using the `subplots` function in Matplotlib. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create adjacent subplots that share a common x-axis.

> You can write code in `ganged-plots.ipynb`.
