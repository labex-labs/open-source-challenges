# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. One of the key features of Matplotlib is its ability to create 2D and 3D plots of all types and styles, including scatter plots, line plots, and bar charts. In this lab, you will learn how to create a polar curve in a rectangular box using Matplotlib.
