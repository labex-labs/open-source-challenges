# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use tick formatters in Matplotlib by passing a string or function to `~.Axis.set_major_formatter` or `~.Axis.set_minor_formatter`, or by creating an instance of one of the various `~.ticker.Formatter` classes and providing that to `~.Axis.set_major_formatter` or `~.Axis.set_minor_formatter`. We also learned how to set up a plot with tick positions, tick length, and a title.
