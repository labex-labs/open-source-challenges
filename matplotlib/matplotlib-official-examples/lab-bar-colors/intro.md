# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create bar chart using Python's Matplotlib library. We will focus on how to control the color of the bars and the legend entries. This will help us create a visually appealing chart that is easy to read and understand.

> You can write code in `bar-colors.ipynb`.
