# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create bar chart using Python's Matplotlib library. We focused on how to control the color of the bars and the legend entries. We also learned how to customize the chart by adding axis labels and a title. By following these steps, we can create visually appealing charts that are easy to read and understand.
