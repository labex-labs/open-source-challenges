# Define Data for the Chart

Next, we need to define the data that we want to use to create the chart. In this example, we will be creating a chart that shows the supply of different types of fruits. We will define the fruit names, the supply counts, the bar colors, and the legend labels as follows:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange']
counts = [40, 100, 30, 55]
bar_labels = ['red', 'blue', '_red', 'orange']
bar_colors = ['tab:red', 'tab:blue', 'tab:red', 'tab:orange']
```
