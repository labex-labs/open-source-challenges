# Summary

This tutorial demonstrated how to generate high-resolution tricontouring plots with Matplotlib. We started by generating a set of random test data points, performing a Delaunay triangulation on those points, masking out some of the triangles in the mesh, refining and interpolating the data, and finally plotting the refined data using Matplotlib's `tricontour` function.
