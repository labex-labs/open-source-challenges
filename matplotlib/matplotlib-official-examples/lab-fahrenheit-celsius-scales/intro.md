# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to display two scales on the left and right y-axis. This example uses the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. We will use a closure function to register as a callback to update the second axis according to the first axis.

> You can write code in `fahrenheit-celsius-scales.ipynb`.
