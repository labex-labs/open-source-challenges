# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create hatch-filled histograms using Matplotlib. A histogram is a graphical representation of data that uses bars to show the frequency of numerical data. A hatch-filled histogram is a histogram in which the bars are filled with a pattern of lines, dots, or other symbols.
