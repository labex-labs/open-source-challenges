# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create hatch-filled histograms using Matplotlib. We defined two functions: `filled_hist` to draw a histogram as a stepped patch, and `stack_hist` to create a stacked histogram. We also set up a histogram function with fixed bins using `numpy.histogram`, and defined three style cycles for the histograms using `cycler`. Finally, we generated random data and created two hatch-filled histograms using the `stack_hist` function.
