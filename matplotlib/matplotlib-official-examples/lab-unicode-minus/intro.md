# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to control the tick labels in a Matplotlib plot using Unicode minus and ASCII hyphen. By default, tick labels at negative values are rendered using a Unicode minus rather than an ASCII hyphen. However, this can be controlled by setting `axes.unicode_minus`. We will use a sample code snippet to showcase the difference between the two glyphs in a magnified font.

> You can write code in `unicode-minus.ipynb`.
