# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to control the tick labels in a Matplotlib plot using Unicode minus and ASCII hyphen. We used a sample code snippet to showcase the difference between the two glyphs in a magnified font. By setting `axes.unicode_minus` to `False`, we can change the default behavior of rendering tick labels at negative values using a Unicode minus.
