# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to rotate text objects in Matplotlib relative to a line or object on a plot rather than the screen coordinate system. This technique can be helpful when you want to rotate text in relation to something specific on the plot.

> You can open the `text-rotation-relative-to-line.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
