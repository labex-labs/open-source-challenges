# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to rotate text objects in Matplotlib relative to a line or object on a plot rather than the screen coordinate system. This technique can be helpful when you want to rotate text in relation to something specific on the plot.

> You can write code in `text-rotation-relative-to-line.ipynb`.
