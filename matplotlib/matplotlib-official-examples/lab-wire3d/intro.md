# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a 3D wireframe plot using Python's Matplotlib library. A wireframe plot is a visual representation of a 3D surface where lines are drawn between each point on the surface. This type of plot is useful for visualizing complex 3D data and can be customized to create impressive visualizations.

> You can open the `wire3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
