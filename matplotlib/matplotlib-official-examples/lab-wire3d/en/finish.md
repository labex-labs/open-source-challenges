# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a 3D wireframe plot using Python's Matplotlib library. We generated the data using NumPy, created the plot using the `plot_wireframe()` function, and customized the plot to make it more visually appealing. We also learned how to add a title, axis labels, and change the color of the plot. With this knowledge, we can create impressive 3D visualizations of complex data.
