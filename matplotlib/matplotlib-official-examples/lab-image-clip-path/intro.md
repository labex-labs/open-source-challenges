# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to clip an image with patches using Python's Matplotlib library. Clipping an image with patches allows you to highlight specific areas of the image, or crop the image to a specific shape.

You can open the `image-clip-path.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
