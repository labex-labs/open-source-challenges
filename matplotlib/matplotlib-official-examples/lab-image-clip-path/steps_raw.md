# Clipping Images with Patches

## Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to clip an image with patches using Python's Matplotlib library. Clipping an image with patches allows you to highlight specific areas of the image, or crop the image to a specific shape.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Libraries

To get started, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will be using Matplotlib to display the image and create the patch, and the `cbook` library to load the sample image.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
import matplotlib.patches as patches
```

### Step 2: Load the Image

We will use the `get_sample_data` method from `cbook` to load a sample image. This method returns a file-like object, which we can pass to `imshow` to display the image.

```python
with cbook.get_sample_data('grace_hopper.jpg') as image_file:
    image = plt.imread(image_file)
```

### Step 3: Display the Image

Now we can display the image using Matplotlib's `imshow` method. We will also turn off the axis so that we only see the image.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
im = ax.imshow(image)
ax.axis('off')
```

### Step 4: Create the Patch

To create the patch, we will use Matplotlib's `patches` module. We will create a circular patch with a radius of 200 pixels, centered at the point (260, 200).

```python
patch = patches.Circle((260, 200), radius=200, transform=ax.transData)
```

### Step 5: Clip the Image

Finally, we will clip the image using the `set_clip_path` method of the image. This method takes the patch as an argument and clips the image to the shape of the patch.

```python
im.set_clip_path(patch)
```

### Step 6: Display the Clipped Image

We can now display the clipped image using Matplotlib's `show` method.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to clip an image with patches using Python's Matplotlib library. We loaded a sample image, created a circular patch, and clipped the image to the shape of the patch. Clipping images with patches can be useful for highlighting specific areas of an image or cropping the image to a specific shape.
