# Import Libraries

To get started, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will be using Matplotlib to display the image and create the patch, and the `cbook` library to load the sample image.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
import matplotlib.patches as patches
```
