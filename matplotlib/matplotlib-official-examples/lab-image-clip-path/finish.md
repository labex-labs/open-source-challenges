# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to clip an image with patches using Python's Matplotlib library. We loaded a sample image, created a circular patch, and clipped the image to the shape of the patch. Clipping images with patches can be useful for highlighting specific areas of an image or cropping the image to a specific shape.
