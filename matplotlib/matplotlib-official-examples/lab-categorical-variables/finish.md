# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to plot categorical variables using Matplotlib. We created bar plots, scatter plots, and line plots to visualize different types of categorical data. By customizing the axes labels, titles, and legends, we can create informative and visually appealing plots to communicate our data effectively.
