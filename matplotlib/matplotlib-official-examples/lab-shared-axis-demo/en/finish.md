# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create plots with shared axes using the Matplotlib library in Python. We created subplots, plotted data on each subplot, customized tick labels, removed tick labels, set the axis limits, and displayed the plots. Shared axes can be useful when you want to compare different data sets with the same scale.
