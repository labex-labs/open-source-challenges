In this lab, you will learn how to create plots with shared axes using the Matplotlib library in Python. Shared axes can be useful when you want to compare different data sets with the same scale.

> You can open the `shared-axis-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
