# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to set the behavior of tick auto-placement in Matplotlib by switching `axes.autolimit_mode` to 'round_numbers'. We also learned how to set an additional margin around the data while the round numbers autolimit_mode is still respected. These techniques can be used to customize the tick positions on the axis and improve the readability of the plot.
