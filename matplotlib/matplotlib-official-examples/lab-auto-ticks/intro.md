# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to set the behavior of tick auto-placement in Matplotlib. By default, Matplotlib will choose the number of ticks and tick positions so that there is a reasonable number of ticks on the axis and they are located at "round" numbers. However, there may be no ticks on the edges of the plot. We will learn how to switch the `axes.autolimit_mode` to 'round_numbers' to keep ticks at round numbers and also have ticks at the edges.

> You can write code in `auto-ticks.ipynb`.
