# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to interact with a Matplotlib plot using mouse move and click events. By connecting to these events, we can perform various actions like printing the coordinates of the mouse pointer, disconnecting callbacks, etc. This technique can be useful to create interactive visualizations in Python.
