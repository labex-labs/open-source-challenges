# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create custom legends using Matplotlib objects. We started by plotting a set of lines and generating a default legend. Next, we composed a custom legend using `Line2D` objects with custom attributes. Finally, we created a custom legend using different Matplotlib objects, including `Line2D` and `Patch`. By using custom legends, we can provide a clear and concise explanation of the data represented in a plot.
