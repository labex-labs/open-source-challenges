# Introduction

The Python Matplotlib library provides a flexible way to create and customize legends in a plot. Legends are an essential component of any plot, as they provide a clear and concise explanation of the data represented in the plot. This lab will guide you through the process of composing custom legends using Matplotlib objects.
