# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a looking glass effect using mouse events in Matplotlib. We generated random data, plotted the data, and created an event handler class to handle mouse events. By left-clicking and dragging the yellow circle patch, we were able to move it around the plot and inspect data within the circular area.
