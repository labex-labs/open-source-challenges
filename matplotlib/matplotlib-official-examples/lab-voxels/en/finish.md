# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a 3D voxel plot using the Matplotlib library in Python. We prepared the coordinates for the plot, created the cubes and link, set the colors for each object, and plotted the voxel array using the `Axes3D.voxels` function. Voxel plots are a useful way to visualize 3D data, and Matplotlib makes it easy to create them.
