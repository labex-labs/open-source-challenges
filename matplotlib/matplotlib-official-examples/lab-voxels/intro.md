# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a 3D voxel plot using the Matplotlib library in Python. Voxel plots are useful for visualizing 3D data in a way that is both clear and aesthetically pleasing. In this lab, we will be using the `Axes3D.voxels` function to create a voxel plot of two cubes and a link between them.
