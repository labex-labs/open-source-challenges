# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create multicolored lines in Matplotlib. We used the `LineCollection` function to create a set of line segments and color them individually based on their derivative. We also learned how to use a boundary norm to color the line segments. We used the `Normalize` function to normalize the `dydx` values between its minimum and maximum, and the `ListedColormap` function to create a colormap with three colors - red, green, and blue. We used the `BoundaryNorm` function to create a boundary norm with boundaries -1, -0.5, 0.5, and 1, and the `ListedColormap`. Finally, we used the `subplots` function to create a 2x1 grid of subplots, and the `sharex` and `sharey` parameters to share the x and y axes between the subplots. We then showed the plot using the `show` function.
