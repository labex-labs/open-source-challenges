# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create multicolored lines in Matplotlib. We will use the `LineCollection` function to create a set of line segments and color them individually based on their derivative. We will also learn how to use a boundary norm to color the line segments.

> You can write code in `multicolored-line.ipynb`.
