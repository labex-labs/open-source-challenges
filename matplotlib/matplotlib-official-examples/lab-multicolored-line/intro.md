# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create multicolored lines in Matplotlib. We will use the `LineCollection` function to create a set of line segments and color them individually based on their derivative. We will also learn how to use a boundary norm to color the line segments.

You can open the `multicolored-line.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
