# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Python's Matplotlib library to convert texts to images. This is useful when we want to include text in an image or visualization, or when we want to create images of text for use in machine learning or computer vision applications.

> You can open the `mathtext-asarray.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
