# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Matplotlib to convert texts to images. We used the `text_to_rgba` function to convert text to an RGBA image, and then used `.Figure.figimage` and `.Figure.text` to draw the text image or text to a figure. This is useful for creating images of text for use in machine learning or computer vision applications, or for including text in visualizations.
