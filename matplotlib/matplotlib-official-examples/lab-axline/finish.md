# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to draw infinite lines in Matplotlib using `axvline`, `axhline`, and `axline`. We learned how to draw vertical and horizontal lines, arbitrary lines, and diagonal lines with a fixed slope. These functions are useful for marking special data values or for drawing grid lines to aid in data analysis.
