# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create an interactive plot with a textbox using Matplotlib. We created an initial plot, defined a `submit` function that updates the plot, created a Textbox widget, and displayed the plot to the user. With this knowledge, you can create your own interactive plots with user input.
