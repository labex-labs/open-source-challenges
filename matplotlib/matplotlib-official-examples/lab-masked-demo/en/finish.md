# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to plot data with missing values using Matplotlib. We explored three methods: removing undesired data points, masking points, and setting values to NaN. We created data to plot using NumPy and used different markers and colors to differentiate the datasets. We also interpreted the resulting plot to understand the different methods of visualizing missing data.
