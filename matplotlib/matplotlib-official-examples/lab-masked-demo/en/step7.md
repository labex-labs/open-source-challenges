# Interpret the Plot

The resulting plot will have four lines of different colors and markers. The first line (light grey) represents the original data with no masking. The second line (orange) represents the data with undesired points removed. The third line (green) represents the data with masked values. The fourth line (blue) represents the data with NaN values. This plot shows how missing data can be visualized using different methods.
