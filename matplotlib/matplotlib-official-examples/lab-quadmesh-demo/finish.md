# Summary

This tutorial provided a step-by-step guide to creating a QuadMesh plot using the Matplotlib library. We learned how to handle masked data in the plot and how to customize the colormap for the masked region. The QuadMesh plot is a powerful tool for visualizing 2D data and is particularly useful for scientific applications.
