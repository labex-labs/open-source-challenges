# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the usage of the Matplotlib library to create a QuadMesh plot. QuadMesh is a faster generalization of the pcolor function, but with some restrictions. The demo in this tutorial will illustrate a bug in QuadMesh with masked data.

> You can write code in `quadmesh-demo.ipynb`.
