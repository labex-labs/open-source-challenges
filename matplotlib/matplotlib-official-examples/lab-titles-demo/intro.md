# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to position the titles of plots in Matplotlib. Matplotlib can display plot titles centered, flush with the left side of a set of axes, and flush with the right side of a set of axes. This lab will show you how to use Matplotlib to position plot titles in different ways.

> You can write code in `titles-demo.ipynb`.
