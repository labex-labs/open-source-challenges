# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to position the titles of plots in Matplotlib. Matplotlib can display plot titles centered, flush with the left side of a set of axes, and flush with the right side of a set of axes. This lab will show you how to use Matplotlib to position plot titles in different ways.

> You can open the `titles-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
