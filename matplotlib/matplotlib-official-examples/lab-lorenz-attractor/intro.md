# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial for plotting Edward Lorenz's 1963 "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow" in a 3-dimensional space using mplot3d. We will use Python and Matplotlib, which is a plotting library for the Python programming language.

> You can open the `lorenz-attractor.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
