# Import Required Libraries

We will first import all the required libraries for this project, which include `re`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.patches`, and `matplotlib.path`.

```python
import re
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.patches as patches
from matplotlib.path import Path
```
