# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a Bezier Curve using Python's Matplotlib library. A Bezier Curve is a mathematical curve that is commonly used in computer graphics to create smooth and aesthetically pleasing shapes. We will create a simple example of a Bezier Curve using Matplotlib's `PathPatch` object.
