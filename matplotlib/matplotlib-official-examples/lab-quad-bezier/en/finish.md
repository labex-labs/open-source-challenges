# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a Bezier Curve using Python's Matplotlib library. We used the `Path` and `PathPatch` objects to create the curve and added it to a plot. We also plotted a red point on the curve to show that it lies on the curve. The Bezier Curve is commonly used in computer graphics to create smooth and aesthetically pleasing shapes.
