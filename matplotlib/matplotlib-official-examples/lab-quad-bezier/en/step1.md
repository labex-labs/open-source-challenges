# Importing Libraries

To create a Bezier Curve using Matplotlib, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will import `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the plot and `matplotlib.patches` for creating the `PathPatch` object.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import matplotlib.path as mpath
```
