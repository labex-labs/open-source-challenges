# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the Matplotlib ImageGrid to display a collection of images in a grid format with fixed aspect ratios. We created two ImageGrids and set the aspect ratio of the cells in each ImageGrid to 2. We then displayed our ImageGrids using the `plt.show()` function.
