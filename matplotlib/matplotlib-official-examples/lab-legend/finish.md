# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a legend with pre-defined labels in Matplotlib. We used the `plot` function to plot three lines on the same graph, and used the `label` parameter to assign labels to each line. We then used the `legend` function to add the legend to the plot, and styled the legend to make it more visually appealing. By following these steps, you can create legends for your own plots in Matplotlib.
