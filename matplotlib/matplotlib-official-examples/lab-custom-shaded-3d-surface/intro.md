# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use custom hillshading in a 3D surface plot using Python Matplotlib. Hillshading is the use of light and shadow to enhance the perception of depth and relief in a 3D plot. By customizing the hillshading, we can create a more visually appealing and informative plot.

You can open the `custom-shaded-3d-surface.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
