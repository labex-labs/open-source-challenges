# Introduction

This lab will guide you on how to create a scatter plot with histograms using Matplotlib. A scatter plot with histograms is a great way to visualize the distribution of two variables and their relationship. The scatter plot displays the relationship between the two variables, while the histograms show the distribution of each variable independently.

> You can write code in `scatter-hist.ipynb`.
