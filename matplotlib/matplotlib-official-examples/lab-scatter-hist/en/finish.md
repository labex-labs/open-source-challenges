# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a scatter plot with histograms using Matplotlib. We defined the scatter_hist function, generated random data, defined the axes positions using a gridspec and inset_axes, and displayed the plot. Scatter plots with histograms are a great way to visualize the distribution of two variables and their relationship.
