# Define the axes positions using inset_axes

We can also use `inset_axes` to position the marginals _outside_ the main axes. The advantage of doing so is that the aspect ratio of the main axes can be fixed, and the marginals will always be drawn relative to the position of the axes.

```python
# Create a Figure, which doesn't have to be square.
fig = plt.figure(layout='constrained')
# Create the main axes, leaving 25% of the figure space at the top and on the right to position marginals.
ax = fig.add_gridspec(top=0.75, right=0.75).subplots()
# The main axes' aspect can be fixed.
ax.set(aspect=1)
# Create marginal axes, which have 25% of the size of the main axes.
# Note that the inset axes are positioned *outside* (on the right and the top) of the main axes,
# by specifying axes coordinates greater than 1.
# Axes coordinates less than 0 would likewise specify positions on the left and the bottom of the main axes.
ax_histx = ax.inset_axes([0, 1.05, 1, 0.25], sharex=ax)
ax_histy = ax.inset_axes([1.05, 0, 0.25, 1], sharey=ax)
# Draw the scatter plot and marginals.
scatter_hist(x, y, ax, ax_histx, ax_histy)
```
