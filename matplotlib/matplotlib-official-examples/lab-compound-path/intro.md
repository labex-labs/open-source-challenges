# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a compound path using Matplotlib in Python. A compound path is a collection of simple paths that can be used to create complex shapes. We will create a compound path by combining two simple polygons, a rectangle, and a triangle.

> You can write code in `compound-path.ipynb`.
