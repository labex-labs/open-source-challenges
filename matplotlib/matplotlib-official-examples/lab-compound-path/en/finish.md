# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a compound path using Matplotlib in Python. We created a compound path by combining two simple polygons, a rectangle, and a triangle. We used `Path` to create the path from the vertices and codes, and `PathPatch` to create a patch from the path. Finally, we added the patch to the plot to display the compound path.
