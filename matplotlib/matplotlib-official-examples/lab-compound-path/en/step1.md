# Importing the Required Libraries

We will start by importing the required libraries. We need `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the plot, `matplotlib.patches` for creating patches, `matplotlib.path.Path` for creating paths, and `numpy` for creating arrays.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import PathPatch
from matplotlib.path import Path
import numpy as np
```
