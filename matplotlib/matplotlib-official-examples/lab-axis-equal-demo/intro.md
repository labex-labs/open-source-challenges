# Introduction

In data visualization, it is important to present information in an accurate and visually appealing way. One way to achieve this is by setting equal axis aspect ratios in plots. This ensures that the x and y axes are scaled equally, resulting in a proportional representation of the data. In this tutorial, we will learn how to set and adjust plots with equal axis aspect ratios using Python's Matplotlib library.
