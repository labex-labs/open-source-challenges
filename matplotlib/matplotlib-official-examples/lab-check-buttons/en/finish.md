# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use check buttons in Python Matplotlib. We created a plot with three different sine waves, and the ability to choose which waves are displayed with the check buttons. We used the `CheckButtons` function to create the buttons and defined a callback function to toggle the visibility of the corresponding line on the plot.
