# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to use check buttons in Python Matplotlib. Check buttons allow users to turn visual elements on and off with check buttons, similar to check boxes. We will use the `CheckButtons` function to create a plot with three different sine waves, and the ability to choose which waves are displayed with the check buttons.

> You can write code in `check-buttons.ipynb`.
