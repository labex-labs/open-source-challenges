# Check the Data Type

The first step is to check the data type of the x-axis values. If it is a list of strings, it is likely that the tick behavior is unexpected. To fix this, we need to convert the strings to numeric types. Here is an example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# create example data
x = ['1', '5', '2', '3']
y = [1, 4, 2, 3]

# plot the data with string tick labels
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y, 'd')
ax.set_xlabel('Categories')
plt.show()
```

In this example, we have a list of strings on the x-axis. When we plot the data, the tick labels are out of order and misplaced.
