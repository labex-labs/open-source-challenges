# Summary

In summary, when working with Matplotlib, it is important to check the data type of the x-axis values. If they are strings, we need to convert them to numeric types to fix unexpected tick behavior. If there are too many ticks, we also need to convert the strings to numeric types. When working with datetime values, we need to convert the strings to datetime objects to get the proper date locators and formatters.
