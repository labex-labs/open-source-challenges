# Introduction

When working with Matplotlib, it is common to encounter unexpected tick behavior, such as too many ticks or ticks that are out of order. This is often caused by passing a list of strings instead of numbers or datetime objects, which Matplotlib treats as categorical variables by default. This lab will provide step-by-step instructions on how to fix too many ticks in Matplotlib.
