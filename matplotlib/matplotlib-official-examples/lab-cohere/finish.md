# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to plot the coherence of two signals using Python's Matplotlib library. We generated two signals with a coherent part at 10 Hz and a random part, added white noise to the signals, and plotted the signals in the time domain and their coherence using Matplotlib's `cohere` function.
