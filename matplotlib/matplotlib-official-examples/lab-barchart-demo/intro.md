# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a horizontal bar chart using Python's Matplotlib library. We will use the example of gym teachers wanting to show parents how their child did across a handful of fitness tests, relative to other children. We will make up some data for little Johnny Doe to extract the plotting code for demo purposes.

You can open the `barchart-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
