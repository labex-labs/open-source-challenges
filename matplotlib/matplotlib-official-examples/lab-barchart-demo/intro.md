# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a horizontal bar chart using Python's Matplotlib library. We will use the example of gym teachers wanting to show parents how their child did across a handful of fitness tests, relative to other children. We will make up some data for little Johnny Doe to extract the plotting code for demo purposes.

> You can write code in `barchart-demo.ipynb`.
