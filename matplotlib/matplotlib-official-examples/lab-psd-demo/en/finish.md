# Summary

In this tutorial, we have shown you how to plot the Power Spectral Density (PSD) using the Matplotlib library in Python. We began by plotting a basic PSD, then compared it to the equivalent MATLAB code. We then plotted the PSD with different amounts of zero padding, followed by plotting the PSD of a complex signal.
