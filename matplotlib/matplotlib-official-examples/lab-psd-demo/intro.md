# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of plotting the Power Spectral Density (PSD) using the Matplotlib library in Python. The PSD is a plot commonly used in the field of signal processing. NumPy has many useful libraries for computing a PSD, and we will show a few examples of how this can be accomplished and visualized with Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `psd-demo.ipynb`.
