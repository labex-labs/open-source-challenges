# Introduction

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. Matplotlib was originally developed by John D. Hunter in 2003.

This tutorial will guide you on how to use the `.step()` and `.plot()` functions in Matplotlib.
