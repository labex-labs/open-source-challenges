# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. In this lab, we will be using Matplotlib to create a polygon programmatically or interactively. The polygon can be used to highlight a region of interest or to mask out a certain area of a plot.

> You can write code in `polygon-selector-simple.ipynb`.
