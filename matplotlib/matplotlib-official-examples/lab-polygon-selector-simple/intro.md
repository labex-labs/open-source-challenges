# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for data visualization. In this lab, we will be using Matplotlib to create a polygon programmatically or interactively. The polygon can be used to highlight a region of interest or to mask out a certain area of a plot.

> You can open the `polygon-selector-simple.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
