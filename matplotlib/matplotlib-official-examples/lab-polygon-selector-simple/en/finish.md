# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a polygon programmatically and interactively using Matplotlib. We also learned how to add vertices to a `PolygonSelector` object and plot the resulting polygon on an `Axes`. This knowledge can be useful for highlighting regions of interest or masking out certain areas in a plot.
