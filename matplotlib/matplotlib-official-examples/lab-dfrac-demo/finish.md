# Summary

In this tutorial, we discussed the differences between \dfrac and \frac TeX macros when using Mathtex in Matplotlib. We demonstrated how to plot data with both macros and display the resulting plots. By default, \frac produces a smaller, in-line style fraction, while \dfrac produces a larger, display style fraction.
