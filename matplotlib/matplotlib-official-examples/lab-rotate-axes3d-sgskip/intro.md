# Introduction

This lab will guide you on how to create a simple animation of a rotating 3D plot about all three axes using Matplotlib. We will use a sample dataset to create a basic wireframe, set axis labels, and rotate the axes.

You can open the `rotate-axes3d-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
