# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a simple animation of a rotating 3D plot about all three axes using Matplotlib. We used a sample dataset to create a basic wireframe, set axis labels, and rotated the axes. We also learned how to use the `ax.view_init()`, `plt.title()`, `plt.draw()`, and `plt.pause()` functions to update the plot and display the animation.
