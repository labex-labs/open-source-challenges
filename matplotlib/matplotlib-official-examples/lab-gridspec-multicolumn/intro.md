# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for the Python programming language. It provides a wide range of tools for creating different types of plots and charts. The GridSpec module in Matplotlib allows us to create flexible and complex layouts of subplots. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use GridSpec to create multi-column/row subplot layouts.
