# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to customize the appearance of violin plots using Matplotlib. We created a default violin plot, then modified it by changing the color and opacity of the violin bodies, and adding a simplified box plot representation on top. We also set the style for the x-axis tick labels and limits. By customizing the appearance of the plot, we can create more informative and visually appealing visualizations.
