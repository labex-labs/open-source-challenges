# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to customize violin plots using Matplotlib. Violin plots are a powerful tool for visualizing the distribution and density of data. By customizing the appearance of the plot, we can create more informative and visually appealing visualizations.

> You can write code in `customized-violin.ipynb`.
