# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to configure axis style in Matplotlib. We will be using the `mpl_toolkits.axisartist` axes classes to add arrows at the ends of each axis and to add X and Y-axis from the origin. We will also hide the borders of the plot.

> You can write code in `demo-axisline-style.ipynb`.
