# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create color maps using Matplotlib. Color maps are useful when visualizing data, as they provide a way to represent numerical data through colors. Matplotlib provides a variety of built-in color maps, as well as the ability to create custom color maps.

> You can write code in `colormap-reference.ipynb`.
