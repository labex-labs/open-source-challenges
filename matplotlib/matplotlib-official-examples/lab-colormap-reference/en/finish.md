# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create color maps using Matplotlib. You learned about the `ListedColormap` and `LinearSegmentedColormap` classes from the `matplotlib.colors` module, as well as the built-in color maps provided by Matplotlib. You also learned how to reverse a color map and create custom color maps.
