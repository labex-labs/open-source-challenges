# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to enable picking on various artists in Matplotlib, including lines, rectangles, text, scatter plots, and images. We also learned how to define custom hit test functions to enable more complex picking behavior. This powerful tool allows us to create interactive visualizations that respond to user actions.
