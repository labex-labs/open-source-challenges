# Introduction

This lab aims to introduce you to the concept of picking in Matplotlib. The ability to pick artists is a powerful tool that can be used to build interactive visualizations that respond to user actions. We will cover simple picking, picking with custom hit test functions, picking on a scatter plot, and picking images.

> You can write code in `pick-event-demo.ipynb`.
