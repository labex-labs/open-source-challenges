# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a filled polygon using Matplotlib in Python. We will use the Koch snowflake as an example polygon.

> You can open the `fill.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
