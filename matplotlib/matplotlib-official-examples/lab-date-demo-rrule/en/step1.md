# Import the necessary libraries

First, you need to import the necessary libraries, including Matplotlib, NumPy, and datetime.

```python
import datetime
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.dates import (YEARLY, DateFormatter, RRuleLocator, drange,
                              rrulewrapper)
```
