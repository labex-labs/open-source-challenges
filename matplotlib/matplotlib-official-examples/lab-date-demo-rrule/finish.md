# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use recurrence rules in Matplotlib to place custom date ticks on a plot. You first set the recurrence rule using the rrulewrapper function, and then used the RRuleLocator and DateFormatter functions to set the tick locator and formatter. Finally, you plotted the data and set the x-axis ticks using the tick locator and formatter functions.
