# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use recurrence rules in Matplotlib to place date ticks. The `iCalender RFC`\_ specifies recurrence rules (rrules), that define date sequences. You can use rrules in Matplotlib to place date ticks. This example sets custom date ticks on every 5th Easter.

> You can open the `date-demo-rrule.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
