# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use recurrence rules in Matplotlib to place date ticks. The `iCalender RFC`\_ specifies recurrence rules (rrules), that define date sequences. You can use rrules in Matplotlib to place date ticks. This example sets custom date ticks on every 5th Easter.

> You can write code in `date-demo-rrule.ipynb`.
