# Introduction

In data analysis, it's often necessary to create 3D plots to visualize data. In Matplotlib, we can create 3D plots as subplots to compare different 3D data. This lab will demonstrate how to create 3D plots as subplots using Matplotlib.

You can open the `subplot3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
