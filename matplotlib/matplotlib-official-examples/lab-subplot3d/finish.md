# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create 3D plots as subplots using Matplotlib. We created a figure with two subplots, a 3D surface plot, and a 3D wireframe plot. We used NumPy to create the data for the 3D surface plot and the `get_test_data` function from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d to create the data for the 3D wireframe plot. We also added a color bar to the 3D surface plot and set the limits for the z-axis.
