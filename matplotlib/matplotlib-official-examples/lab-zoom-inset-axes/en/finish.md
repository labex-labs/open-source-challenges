# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a zoomed-in region in a Matplotlib plot. We created a main plot using sample data, added an inset plot to show a zoomed-in region of the main plot, and added a rectangle to show where the zoomed-in region is located. We then displayed the plot using the `plt.show()` function.
