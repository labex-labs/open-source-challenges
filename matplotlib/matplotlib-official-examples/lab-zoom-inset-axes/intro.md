# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is a powerful tool for data visualization, and it is widely used in the scientific community. In this lab, we will learn how to create a zoomed-in region in a Matplotlib plot.

You can open the `zoom-inset-axes.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
