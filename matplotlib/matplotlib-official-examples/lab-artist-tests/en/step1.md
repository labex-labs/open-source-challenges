# Import Libraries

First, you need to import the necessary libraries. You will use `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the plot, `numpy` for generating random data, and `matplotlib.collections`, `matplotlib.lines`, `matplotlib.patches`, and `matplotlib.text` for creating different types of artists.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.collections as collections
import matplotlib.lines as lines
import matplotlib.patches as patches
import matplotlib.text as text
```
