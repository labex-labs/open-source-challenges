# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create artists with units in Matplotlib. You will create different types of artists, such as a line, text, and patch, and add them to a plot. You will also set the units for the x and y axes, and learn how to convert units to scalars.

> You can write code in `artist-tests.ipynb`.
