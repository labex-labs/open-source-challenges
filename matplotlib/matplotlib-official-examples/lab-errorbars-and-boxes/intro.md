# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create box plots from error bars using PatchCollection. Box plots are useful for displaying the range and distribution of data. By adding a rectangle patch defined by the limits of the bars in both the x- and y-directions, we can make a more visually appealing error bar plot.
