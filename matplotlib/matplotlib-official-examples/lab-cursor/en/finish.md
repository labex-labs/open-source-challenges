# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the `matplotlib.widgets.Cursor` to interactively display the x and y values of the data point under the cursor. We generated random data points using numpy, created a figure and axes object, plotted the data points, created a cursor object and displayed the plot using `plt.show()`.
