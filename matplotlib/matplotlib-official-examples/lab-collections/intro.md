# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through creating a visualization using Matplotlib collection. The tutorial will show you how to use LineCollection, PolyCollection, and RegularPolyCollection. The tutorial will also show you how to use the offsets and offset_transform keyword arguments of the LineCollection and PolyCollection to set the positions of the spirals. The tutorial will also show you how to use the RegularPolyCollection to make regular polygons.
