# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through creating a hexagonal binned plot using Matplotlib in Python. Hexagonal binned plots are 2D histogram plots in which the bins are hexagons and the color represents the number of data points within each bin. They are useful for visualizing the distribution of large datasets.

> You can write code in `hexbin-demo.ipynb`.
