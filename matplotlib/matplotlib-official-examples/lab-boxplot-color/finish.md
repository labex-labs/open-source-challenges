# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create custom fill colors for box plots using Python Matplotlib. We started by importing the required libraries, creating random test data, and then creating rectangular and notched box plots. We then filled the box plots with custom colors and added horizontal grid lines. Box plots are a useful visualization tool for displaying the distribution of data and custom fill colors can be used to make them more visually appealing.
