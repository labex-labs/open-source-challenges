# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating custom fill colors for box plots using Python Matplotlib. Box plots are a type of graph used to display the distribution of a set of data. They show the median, quartiles, and outliers of the data set. In this tutorial, we will use the `boxplot()` function in Matplotlib to create two types of box plots (rectangular and notched) and fill them with custom colors.
