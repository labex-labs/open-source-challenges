# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple GUI using Matplotlib's `Button` widget. The GUI will allow you to modify a sine wave by changing the frequency using the `Next` and `Previous` buttons.

You can open the `buttons.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
