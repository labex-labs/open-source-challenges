# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a 3D bar chart using Python Matplotlib. We will use fake data to plot the chart with and without shading.

> You can open the `3d-bars.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
