# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a visualization with radio buttons using the `matplotlib` library. We used radio buttons to let the user choose between different sine waves to be shown in the plot. We also added functionality to the radio buttons by defining functions that were called when the buttons were clicked. Overall, this lab demonstrated how radio buttons can be used to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore different aspects of the data.
