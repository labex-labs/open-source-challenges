# Introduction

Radio buttons are a type of input element that allows users to select one option from a group of predefined options. In this lab, we will use the `matplotlib` library to create a visualization with radio buttons that let the user choose between different sine waves to be shown in the plot.

> You can write code in `radio-buttons.ipynb`.
