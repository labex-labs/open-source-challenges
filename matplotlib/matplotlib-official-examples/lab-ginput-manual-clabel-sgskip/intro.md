# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the interactive functions in Matplotlib. These interactive functions include ginput, waitforbuttonpress, and manual clabel placement. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to use these functions to create interactive plots in Matplotlib. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create and modify plots using interactive functions in Matplotlib.

You can open the `ginput-manual-clabel-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
