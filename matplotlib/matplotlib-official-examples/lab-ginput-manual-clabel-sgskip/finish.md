# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use interactive functions in Matplotlib to create and modify plots. We used `ginput`, `waitforbuttonpress`, and manual `clabel` placement to define a triangle, contour according to the distance from triangle corners, and zoom in on the plot. By using these functions, we can create interactive plots that allow the user to interact with the data and explore it in more detail.
