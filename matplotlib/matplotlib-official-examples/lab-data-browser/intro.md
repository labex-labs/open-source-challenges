# Introduction

This lab will walk you through how to interact data with multiple canvases. By selecting and highlighting a point on one axis, you will generate the data of that point on the other axis. We will be using Python Matplotlib for this lab.

> You can open the `data-browser.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
