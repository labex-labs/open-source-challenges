# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Hinton diagrams for visualizing weight matrices. Hinton diagrams are very useful when you want to visualize a 2D array, such as a weight matrix. Positive and negative values are represented by white and black squares, respectively, and the size of each square represents the magnitude of each value.
