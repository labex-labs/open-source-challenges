# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Hinton diagrams for visualizing weight matrices. We defined a function called `hinton` that generates the Hinton diagram and then used it to generate a random weight matrix. Hinton diagrams are very useful for visualizing 2D arrays, such as weight matrices, and can be used to quickly identify patterns and trends in the data.
