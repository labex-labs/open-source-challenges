# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use `transforms.offset_copy` to position a drawing element at a specified offset in screen coordinates relative to a location given in any coordinates. We used this function to add text to a scatter plot and a polar plot created using the `matplotlib.pyplot` library in Python.
