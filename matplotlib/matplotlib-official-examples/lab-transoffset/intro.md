# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use `transforms.offset_copy` to position a drawing element, such as a text string, at a specified offset in screen coordinates relative to a location given in any coordinates. We will use the Matplotlib library in Python to create a scatter plot and a polar plot, and then add text to each plot using `offset_copy`.

> You can write code in `transoffset.ipynb`.
