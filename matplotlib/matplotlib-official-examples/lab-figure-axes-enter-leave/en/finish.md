# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Matplotlib's Figure and Axes enter/leave events to change the frame colors of the figure and axes. We created a figure with two subplots, defined event handler functions for entering and leaving the figure and axes, connected the event handlers to the figure canvas, and displayed the figure.
