# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for Python. It offers a variety of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. One of the interactive features of Matplotlib is the ability to detect when the mouse enters and leaves a figure or an axes. In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib's Figure and Axes enter/leave events to change the frame colors of the figure and axes.

> You can open the `figure-axes-enter-leave.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
