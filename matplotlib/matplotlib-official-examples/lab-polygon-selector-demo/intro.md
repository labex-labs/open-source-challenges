# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use the Polygon Selector tool in Matplotlib to select indices from a collection. The Polygon Selector tool allows the user to select points on a graph by drawing a polygon around them. The selected points are then highlighted while the unselected points are faded out. The indices of the selected points are saved in an array, which can then be used for further analysis.
