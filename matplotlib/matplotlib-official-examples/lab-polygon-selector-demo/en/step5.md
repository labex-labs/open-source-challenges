# Select Points

In this step, we will select points from the scatter plot using the Polygon Selector tool. We can select points by drawing a polygon around them. The selected points will be highlighted while the unselected points will be faded out.

```python
print("Select points in the figure by enclosing them within a polygon.")
print("Press the 'esc' key to start a new polygon.")
print("Try holding the 'shift' key to move all of the vertices.")
print("Try holding the 'ctrl' key to move a single vertex.")
plt.show()
```
