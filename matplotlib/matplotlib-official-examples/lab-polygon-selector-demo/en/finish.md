# Summary

This lab demonstrates how to use the Polygon Selector tool in Matplotlib to select indices from a scatter plot. The Selector class allows the user to select points by drawing a polygon around them. The selected points are highlighted while the unselected points are faded out. The indices of the selected points are saved in an array, which can be used for further analysis.
