# Import Libraries

To get started, you need to import the necessary libraries. In this case, we will be using Matplotlib and NumPy. NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
