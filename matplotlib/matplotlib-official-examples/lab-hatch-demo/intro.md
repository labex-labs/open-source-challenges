# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use hatches in Python Matplotlib to add texture to your plots. Hatches are patterns that are used to fill the area of a plot. You can use hatches to differentiate between different parts of your plot or to add visual interest to your plot.

> You can write code in `hatch-demo.ipynb`.
