# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a multiple dataset plot using parasite axis in Python Matplotlib. We used the `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.parasite_axes.host_subplot` and `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axislines.Axes` to create a plot with multiple y-axes. We also learned how to adjust the position of the parasite axes, plot the data, set the axis limits and labels, add legend and color to the plot, and display the plot.
