# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to place text annotations on a 3D plot using Matplotlib library in Python. The following functionalities will be covered:

- Using the `~.Axes3D.text` function with three types of _zdir_ values: None, an axis name (ex. 'x'), or a direction tuple (ex. (1, 1, 0)).
- Using the `~.Axes3D.text` function with the color keyword.
- Using the `.text2D` function to place text on a fixed position on the ax object.
