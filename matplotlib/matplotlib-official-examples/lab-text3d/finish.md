# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to place text annotations on a 3D plot using Matplotlib library in Python. The `~.Axes3D.text` function with different `zdir` values and `color` keyword, as well as the `.text2D` function, were used to place text annotations in the 3D plot. The display region and labels of the 3D plot were also customized.
