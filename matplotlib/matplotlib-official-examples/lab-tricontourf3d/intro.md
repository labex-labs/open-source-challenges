# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a triangular 3D filled contour plot using the Matplotlib library in Python. The plot will be created using unstructured triangular grids and customized triangulation. You will be able to control the view angle and color map of the plot.

> You can open the `tricontourf3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
