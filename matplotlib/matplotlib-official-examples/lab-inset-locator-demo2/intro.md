# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides many tools to create different types of plots and graphs. One of the useful features of Matplotlib is the ability to zoom in on a particular region of a plot, which can help to analyze data more closely. In this lab, we will learn how to create a zoomed inset using Matplotlib.
