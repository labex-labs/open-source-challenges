# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a zoomed inset using Matplotlib. We used the `.zoomed_inset_axes` and `.mark_inset` methods to create two different examples of zoomed insets. By using these methods, we can analyze data more closely and gain insights that may not be visible in the original plot.
