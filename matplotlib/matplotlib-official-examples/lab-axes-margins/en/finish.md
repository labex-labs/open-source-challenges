# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to control view limits and sticky edges in Matplotlib using Python. We learned how to zoom in and out of a plot using `margins()` method instead of `set_xlim()` and `set_ylim()` methods. We also learned how to work around sticky edges in Matplotlib using `use_sticky_edges` property.
