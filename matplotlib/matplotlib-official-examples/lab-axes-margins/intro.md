# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that is used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. In this lab, we will learn how to control view limits and sticky edges in Matplotlib using Python.
