# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that is used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. In this lab, we will learn how to control view limits and sticky edges in Matplotlib using Python.

You can open the `axes-margins.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
