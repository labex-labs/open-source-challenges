# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib, a Python library for creating visualizations, to create a figure and annotate its anatomy. You will learn how to create a figure, plot data, set axis limits, add labels and titles, and annotate the figure with text and markers.

> You can open the `anatomy.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
