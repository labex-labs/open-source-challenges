# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to customize the axis tick and grid properties in a Matplotlib plot using Python. You can use the `grid()` function to control the visibility and style of the grid lines, and the `tick_params()` function to control the appearance of the tick labels. By customizing these properties, you can create more visually appealing and informative plots.
