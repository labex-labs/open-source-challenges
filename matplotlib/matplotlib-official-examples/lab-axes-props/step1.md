# Import Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries. We will be using Matplotlib and NumPy in this lab. NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
