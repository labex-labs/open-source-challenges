# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the steps of creating a simple plot using Matplotlib, a Python library used for data visualization. We will be using the `host_subplot` module to create a plot with two y-axes.

You can open the `simple-axisline4.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
