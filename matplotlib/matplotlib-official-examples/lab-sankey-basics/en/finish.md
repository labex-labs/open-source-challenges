# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create Sankey diagrams using the Matplotlib library in Python. We started with a simple diagram and then customized it by changing the flows, labels, orientations, and other parameters. We also learned how to connect two systems in a Sankey diagram. With these tools, we can create informative and visually appealing flow diagrams for a variety of applications.
