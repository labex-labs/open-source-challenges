# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the pyplot interface in Matplotlib to set and get object properties for visualizing data. We used the `setp` method to set the properties of an object and the `getp` method to get the properties of an object. We also learned about aliases for properties to reduce keystrokes. Matplotlib is a powerful library that allows you to create a wide range of visualizations in Python.
