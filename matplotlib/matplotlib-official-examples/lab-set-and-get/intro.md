# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It allows you to create a wide range of visualizations such as line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and 3D plots. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the pyplot interface to set and get object properties for visualizing data.
