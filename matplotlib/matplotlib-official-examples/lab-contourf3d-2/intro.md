# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a 3D surface graph with filled contour profiles projected onto the walls of the graph. This is a useful visualization technique for understanding complex 3D data. We will be using Python's Matplotlib library to create the graph.

> You can write code in `contourf3d-2.ipynb`.
