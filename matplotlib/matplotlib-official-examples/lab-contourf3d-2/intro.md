# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a 3D surface graph with filled contour profiles projected onto the walls of the graph. This is a useful visualization technique for understanding complex 3D data. We will be using Python's Matplotlib library to create the graph.

> You can open the `contourf3d-2.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
