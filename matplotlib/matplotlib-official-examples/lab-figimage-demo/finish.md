# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Matplotlib's `figimage` function to place images directly in a figure. This can be useful when you want to include images that are not part of your plot. By following the steps outlined in this lab, you should now have a better understanding of how to create and display images in Matplotlib figures.
