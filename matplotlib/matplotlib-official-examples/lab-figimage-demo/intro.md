# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib's `figimage` function to place images directly in a figure, without the need for Axes objects. This can be useful when you want to include images that are not part of your plot, such as a logo or watermark.

> You can open the `figimage-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
