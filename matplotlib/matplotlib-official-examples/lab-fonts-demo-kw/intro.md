# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to set font properties using keyword arguments in Matplotlib. We will explore different font families, styles, variants, weights, and sizes to customize the appearance of our text. We will use Matplotlib's `fig.text()` method to display the different font options.

> You can open the `fonts-demo-kw.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
