# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create an event plot using Matplotlib. An event plot is a way to show the occurrence of events over time. The events can be represented as lines or dots. This lab will guide you through creating horizontal and vertical event plots with different line properties.

> You can write code in `eventplot-demo.ipynb`.
