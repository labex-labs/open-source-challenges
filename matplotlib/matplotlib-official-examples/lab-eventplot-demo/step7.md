# Set line properties for the second event plot

We will use individual values for the line properties in the second event plot. These values will be used for all data sets except for lineoffsets2, which sets the increment between each data set.

```python
colors2 = 'black'
lineoffsets2 = 1
linelengths2 = 1
```
