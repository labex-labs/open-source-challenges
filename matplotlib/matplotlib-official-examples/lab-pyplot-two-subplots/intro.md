# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and subplots, among others. In this lab, you will learn how to create a figure with two subplots using `.pyplot.subplot`.

> You can write code in `pyplot-two-subplots.ipynb`.
