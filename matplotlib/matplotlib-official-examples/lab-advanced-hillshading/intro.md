# Introduction

This lab will walk you through the process of creating shaded plots in Matplotlib using different techniques. You will learn how to display a colorbar for a shaded plot, avoid outliers in a shaded plot, and display different variables through shade and color.

> You can write code in `advanced-hillshading.ipynb`.
