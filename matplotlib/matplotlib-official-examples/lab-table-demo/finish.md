# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Matplotlib table function to display a table within a plot. We used a sample dataset to visualize the loss incurred by different natural disasters over the years. We followed the following steps:

1. Imported Required Libraries
2. Created the Dataset
3. Created Row Labels
4. Created Color Scheme
5. Created Vertical Stacked Bar Chart
6. Reversed Colors and Text Labels
7. Added Table to the Plot
8. Adjusted Plot Layout
9. Added Axis Labels and Title
10. Showed Plot.
