# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the Matplotlib table function to display a table within a plot. We will use a sample dataset to visualize the loss incurred by different natural disasters over the years.

You can open the `table-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
