# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create filled contour plots using the `contourf` method in the Matplotlib library. We covered how to create filled contours with automatic and explicit levels, and how to set the colormap and extend settings. With these skills, you can create beautiful and informative contour plots for your data.
