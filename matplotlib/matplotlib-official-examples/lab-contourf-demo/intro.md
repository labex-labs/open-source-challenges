# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create filled contour plots using the `contourf` method in the Matplotlib library. We will cover how to create filled contours with automatic and explicit levels, and how to set the colormap and extend settings.

> You can open the `contourf-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
