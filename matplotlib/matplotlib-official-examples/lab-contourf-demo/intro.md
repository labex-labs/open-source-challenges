# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create filled contour plots using the `contourf` method in the Matplotlib library. We will cover how to create filled contours with automatic and explicit levels, and how to set the colormap and extend settings.

> You can write code in `contourf-demo.ipynb`.
