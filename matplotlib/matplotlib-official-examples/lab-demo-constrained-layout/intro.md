# Introduction

In data visualization, it is crucial to have clear and readable plots. However, creating multiple subplots can make it difficult to avoid overlaps between axes objects and labels. In such cases, we can use a feature called _constrained layout_ in Matplotlib, which automatically resizes subplots to prevent overlaps between axes objects and labels.
