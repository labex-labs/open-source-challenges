# Summary

_Constrained layout_ is a useful feature in Matplotlib that automatically resizes subplots to prevent overlaps between axes objects and labels. It is particularly useful when creating multiple subplots in a figure. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can create clear and readable plots without having to worry about overlapping labels.
