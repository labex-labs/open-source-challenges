# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use Matplotlib to perform affine transformation of an image. We used the `transforms.Affine2D` function to manipulate the shape and orientation of an image. We performed rotation, skew, scale, reflection, and multiple transformations of the image. We also displayed the transformed image on a plot axis with the intended extent of the image.
