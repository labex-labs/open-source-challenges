# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Matplotlib to perform affine transformation of an image. Affine transformations change the shape and orientation of an image. This lab shows how to use the `transforms.Affine2D` function to manipulate the shape and orientation of an image.

You can open the `affine-image.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
