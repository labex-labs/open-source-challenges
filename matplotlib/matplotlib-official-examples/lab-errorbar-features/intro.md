# Introduction

In data visualization, error bars are a useful tool to display the uncertainty in the data. Error bars are graphical representations of the variability of data and are used on graphs to indicate the error or uncertainty in a reported measurement. In this lab, we will learn about the different ways of specifying error bars in Matplotlib.
