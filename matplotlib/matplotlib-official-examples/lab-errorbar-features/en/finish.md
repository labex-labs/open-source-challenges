# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the different ways of specifying error bars in Matplotlib. We started by importing the necessary libraries and defining our data and error values. We then created plots with variable, symmetric error bars and variable, asymmetric error bars. Finally, we plotted our data with a logarithmic scale and error bars. By using error bars in our visualizations, we can provide valuable information about the uncertainty in the data.
