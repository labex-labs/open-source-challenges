# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through how to assign a log scale for the x-axis using `matplotlib.axes.Axes.semilogx` in Python Matplotlib. A logarithmic scale is useful when the data you want to plot spans several orders of magnitude. In this tutorial, we will use an example of plotting exponential decay as a function of time.

> You can open the `semilogx-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
