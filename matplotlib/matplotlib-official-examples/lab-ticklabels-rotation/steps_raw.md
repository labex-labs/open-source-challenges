# Matplotlib Custom Tick Labels Lab

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for data visualization. One of the key features of Matplotlib is the ability to customize the tick labels on a plot. In this lab, you will learn how to rotate custom tick labels using Matplotlib.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Matplotlib Library

The first step is to import the Matplotlib library. You can do this by running the following code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 2: Create Data for Plotting

The second step is to create the data that you want to plot. For this lab, we will use the following data:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [1, 4, 9, 6]
labels = ['Frogs', 'Hogs', 'Bogs', 'Slogs']
```

### Step 3: Plot the Data

The third step is to plot the data using Matplotlib. You can do this by running the following code:

```python
plt.plot(x, y)
```

### Step 4: Customize the Tick Labels

The fourth step is to customize the tick labels. In this lab, we will rotate the tick labels vertically. You can do this by running the following code:

```python
plt.xticks(x, labels, rotation='vertical')
```

### Step 5: Adjust Margins and Spacing

The fifth step is to adjust the margins and spacing of the plot to ensure that the tick labels are not clipped. You can do this by running the following code:

```python
plt.margins(0.2)
plt.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.15)
```

### Step 6: Show the Plot

The final step is to show the plot using Matplotlib. You can do this by running the following code:

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to rotate custom tick labels using Matplotlib. By customizing the tick labels, you can make your plots more informative and visually appealing.
