# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Matplotlib library to create an interactive plot that allows users to select a set of points using a lasso tool. You will also learn how to use a callback function to change the color of the selected points.

> You can open the `lasso-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
