# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to combine two subplots using subplots and GridSpec in Matplotlib. We created a figure with subplots, got the `GridSpec` from the axes, removed the underlying axes, added a bigger axes, annotated the bigger axes, and adjusted the layout of the subplots. Finally, we displayed the plot using Matplotlib.
