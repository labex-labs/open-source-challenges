# Combining Subplots with GridSpec

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for data visualization. In this lab, we will learn how to combine two subplots using subplots and GridSpec in Matplotlib.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

We start by importing the necessary libraries for this lab. We will be using Matplotlib for data visualization.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 2: Create a Figure with Subplots

We create a figure with three columns and three rows of subplots.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3, nrows=3)
```

### Step 3: Get the GridSpec from the Axes

We get the `GridSpec` from the second row and third column of the subplots.

```python
gs = axs[1, 2].get_gridspec()
```

### Step 4: Remove the Underlying Axes

We remove the underlying axes that are covered by the bigger axes that we will create in the next step.

```python
for ax in axs[1:, -1]:
    ax.remove()
```

### Step 5: Add a Bigger Axes

We add a bigger axes that covers the second and third rows of the last column.

```python
axbig = fig.add_subplot(gs[1:, -1])
```

### Step 6: Annotate the Bigger Axes

We annotate the bigger axes with some text.

```python
axbig.annotate('Big Axes \nGridSpec[1:, -1]', (0.1, 0.5),
               xycoords='axes fraction', va='center')
```

### Step 7: Adjust the Layout

We adjust the layout of the subplots to ensure they fit in the figure.

```python
fig.tight_layout()
```

### Step 8: Display the Plot

We display the plot using Matplotlib.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to combine two subplots using subplots and GridSpec in Matplotlib. We created a figure with subplots, got the `GridSpec` from the axes, removed the underlying axes, added a bigger axes, annotated the bigger axes, and adjusted the layout of the subplots. Finally, we displayed the plot using Matplotlib.
