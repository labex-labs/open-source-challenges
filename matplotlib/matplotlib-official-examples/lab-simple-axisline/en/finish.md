# Summary

We have learned how to create a simple axis line using Matplotlib. We first imported the necessary libraries, then created a figure and subplot with AxesZero. We then hid the top and right axes, made the x axis line visible at y=0, set the axis limits and labels, and finally created a new y2 axis on the right side of the plot.
