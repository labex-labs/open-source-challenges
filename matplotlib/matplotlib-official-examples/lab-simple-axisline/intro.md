# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a simple axis line using Matplotlib. We will use the mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axislines library to create an axis line with x and y axis labels, and a y2 axis label on the right side. We will also learn how to hide the top and right axes, and make the x axis line visible at y=0.

You can open the `simple-axisline.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
