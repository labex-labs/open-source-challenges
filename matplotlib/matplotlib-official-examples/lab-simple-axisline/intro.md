# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a simple axis line using Matplotlib. We will use the mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axislines library to create an axis line with x and y axis labels, and a y2 axis label on the right side. We will also learn how to hide the top and right axes, and make the x axis line visible at y=0.

> You can write code in `simple-axisline.ipynb`.
