# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a PathPatch object using Matplotlib's API. We defined the path data, created a Path object, and used it to create a PathPatch object that we added to the plot. We also plotted the control points and connecting lines of the path and customized the plot by adding a grid and equalizing the axes.
