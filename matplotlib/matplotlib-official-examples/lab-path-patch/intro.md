Matplotlib is a Python library that allows the user to create different types of charts and graphs. It is used in data visualization and data analysis. In this lab, we will learn how to create a PathPatch object using Matplotlib's API.

You can open the `path-patch.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
