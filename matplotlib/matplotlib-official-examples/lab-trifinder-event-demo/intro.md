# Introduction

This lab will guide you through creating a triangulation plot using Matplotlib. You will learn how to create a Triangulation object, use a TriFinder object, and set up interactivity to highlight the triangle under the cursor.

> You can open the `trifinder-event-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
