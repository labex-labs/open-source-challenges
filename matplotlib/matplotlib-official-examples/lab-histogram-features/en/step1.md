# Import necessary libraries

In this step, we will import two libraries: numpy and matplotlib. Numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
