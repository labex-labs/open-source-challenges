# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating figures with titles, subtitles, and global labels using the Matplotlib library in Python. You will learn how to create different types of oscillation plots and how to add a global x- or y-label to a figure.

> You can write code in `figure-title.ipynb`.
