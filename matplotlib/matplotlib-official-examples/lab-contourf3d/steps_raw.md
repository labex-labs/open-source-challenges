# Matplotlib 3D Contour Plot Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. A contour plot is a graphical representation of the relationship between three variables. It is used to display the relationship between two variables on the x and y axes and the third variable on the z-axis. Contour plots are widely used in scientific and engineering fields to display data in a 3D space.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import the Required Libraries

Before we get started, we need to import the required libraries. We will be using `Matplotlib` and `Axes3D` from `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d
```

### Step 2: Create the Figure and Axes Objects

We will now create the figure and axes objects using the `add_subplot()` method. We will set the `projection` parameter to `'3d'` to create a 3D plot.

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
```

### Step 3: Generate the Data

We will now generate the data to be used in the 3D contour plot. We will use the `axes3d.get_test_data()` method to generate the data. This method generates test data for a 3D plot.

```python
X, Y, Z = axes3d.get_test_data(0.05)
```

### Step 4: Create the Contour Plot

We will now create the contour plot using the `contourf()` method. This method creates filled contours. We will set the `cmap` parameter to `cm.coolwarm` to use the cool-warm color map.

```python
ax.contourf(X, Y, Z, cmap=cm.coolwarm)
```

### Step 5: Display the Plot

We will now display the plot using the `show()` method.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. You learned how to import the required libraries, create the figure and axes objects, generate the data, create the contour plot, and display the plot. Contour plots are an effective way to display data in a 3D space, and they are widely used in scientific and engineering fields.
