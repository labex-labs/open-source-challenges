# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. A contour plot is a graphical representation of the relationship between three variables. It is used to display the relationship between two variables on the x and y axes and the third variable on the z-axis. Contour plots are widely used in scientific and engineering fields to display data in a 3D space.
