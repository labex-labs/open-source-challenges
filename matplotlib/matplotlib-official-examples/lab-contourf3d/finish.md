In this lab, you learned how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. You learned how to import the required libraries, create the figure and axes objects, generate the data, create the contour plot, and display the plot. Contour plots are an effective way to display data in a 3D space, and they are widely used in scientific and engineering fields.
