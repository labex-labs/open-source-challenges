# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a line plot with dual axes using Matplotlib library in Python. We used the `host_subplot` and `twinx` functions to create the dual axes and added data using the `plot` function. We formatted the plot by setting the legend, label colors, and line colors. The resulting graph allows us to compare two related variables that have different units of measurement.
