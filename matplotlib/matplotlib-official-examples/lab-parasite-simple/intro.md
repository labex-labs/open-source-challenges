# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a line plot with dual axes using Matplotlib library in Python. We will plot two sets of data with different scales on the same graph. This is useful when we want to compare two related variables that have different units of measurement.

> You can write code in `parasite-simple.ipynb`.
