# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of using the agg backend directly to create images in Python Matplotlib. The agg backend is useful for web application developers who want full control over their code without using the pyplot interface to manage figures, figure closing, etc. In this lab, we will show you how to save the contents of the agg canvas to a file and how to extract them to a numpy array, which can in turn be passed off to Pillow.

You can open the `canvasagg.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
