# Summary

In this lab, we showed you how to use the agg backend in Python Matplotlib to create images. We created a Figure and Canvas, added data to the plot, and saved the plot as a PNG image. We also extracted the renderer buffer to a numpy array and saved the plot as a BMP image using Pillow. These techniques are useful for web application developers who want full control over their code without using the pyplot interface to manage figures, figure closing, etc.
