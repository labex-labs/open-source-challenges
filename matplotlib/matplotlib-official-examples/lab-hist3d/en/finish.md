# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a 3D histogram of 2D data using Python Matplotlib. You also learned how to generate random data, create a 2D histogram, and create a 3D bar graph of the histogram. By following these steps, you can create your own 3D histograms to visualize your own data.
