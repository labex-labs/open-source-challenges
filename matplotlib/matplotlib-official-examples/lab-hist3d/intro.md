# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D histogram of 2D data using Python Matplotlib. A histogram is a graphical representation of data that groups a range of values into bins, and the 3D histogram extends this concept by adding a third dimension to the visualization.

> You can open the `hist3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
