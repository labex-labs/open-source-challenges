# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a 3D histogram of 2D data using Python Matplotlib. A histogram is a graphical representation of data that groups a range of values into bins, and the 3D histogram extends this concept by adding a third dimension to the visualization.

> You can write code in `hist3d.ipynb`.
