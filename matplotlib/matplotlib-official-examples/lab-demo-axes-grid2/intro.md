# Introduction

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Matplotlib's ImageGrid to create a grid of images with shared x and y axes. The tutorial will cover two demos:

- Demo 1 shows how to add a colorbar at each axis.
- Demo 2 shows how to add a shared colorbar.

> You can open the `demo-axes-grid2.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
