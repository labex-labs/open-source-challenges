# Introduction

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use Matplotlib's ImageGrid to create a grid of images with shared x and y axes. The tutorial will cover two demos:

- Demo 1 shows how to add a colorbar at each axis.
- Demo 2 shows how to add a shared colorbar.

> You can write code in `demo-axes-grid2.ipynb`.
