# Import necessary libraries

We will use Matplotlib's ImageGrid to create the grid of images. We will also use numpy to generate sample data and cbook to access a sample dataset.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import cbook
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import ImageGrid
```
