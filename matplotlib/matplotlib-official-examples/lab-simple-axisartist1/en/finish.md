# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create custom spines at specific positions using the Matplotlib library. We created a figure with two subplots and used `axisartist.Axes` and `axisartist.axislines.AxesZero` to create our spines. We also made the other spines invisible and set the xzero axis visible. Finally, we plotted our data and displayed our plot.
