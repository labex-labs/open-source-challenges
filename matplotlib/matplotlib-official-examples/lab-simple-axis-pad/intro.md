# Introduction

This lab will teach you how to use the `add_floating_axis` function in Matplotlib to add floating axes to a plot, which can be used to display additional information about the plot. Specifically, you will learn how to adjust the padding of tick labels and axis labels, as well as how to adjust the position of ticks on the floating axes.

You can open the `simple-axis-pad.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
