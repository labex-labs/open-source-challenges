# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the `add_floating_axis` function in Matplotlib to add floating axes to a plot. You also learned how to adjust the padding of tick labels and axis labels, as well as how to adjust the position of ticks on the floating axes. By the end of this lab, you should be able to create customized plots with floating axes that display additional information about the plot.
