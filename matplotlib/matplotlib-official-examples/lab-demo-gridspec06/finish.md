# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use nested `.GridSpec`s in Matplotlib to create a grid of subplots with varying sizes. We also learned how to generate data using `numpy` and how to customize the spines of the subplots. With this knowledge, you can create complex layouts of plots with precise control over their size and spacing.
