# Matplotlib Nested GridSpecs Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use nested `.GridSpec`s in Matplotlib to create a grid of subplots with varying sizes. This is useful when you want to create a complex layout of plots and have control over the size and spacing of each plot.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will be using `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the plots and `numpy` for generating some data to plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Create Data

In this step, we will create some data to plot. We will use the `squiggle_xy` function to generate some sine and cosine waves with different frequencies.

```python
def squiggle_xy(a, b, c, d):
    i = np.arange(0.0, 2*np.pi, 0.05)
    return np.sin(i*a)*np.cos(i*b), np.sin(i*c)*np.cos(i*d)
```

### Step 3: Create the Figure and Outer Grid

Next, we will create the figure and the outer grid using the `add_gridspec` function. We will create a 4x4 grid with no spacing between the subplots.

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
outer_grid = fig.add_gridspec(4, 4, wspace=0, hspace=0)
```

### Step 4: Create the Inner Grids and Subplots

In this step, we will create the inner grids and subplots using nested `.GridSpec`s. We will loop through each cell in the outer grid and create a 3x3 grid for each cell.

```python
for a in range(4):
    for b in range(4):
        # gridspec inside gridspec
        inner_grid = outer_grid[a, b].subgridspec(3, 3, wspace=0, hspace=0)
        axs = inner_grid.subplots()  # Create all subplots for the inner grid.
        for (c, d), ax in np.ndenumerate(axs):
            ax.plot(*squiggle_xy(a + 1, b + 1, c + 1, d + 1))
            ax.set(xticks=[], yticks=[])
```

### Step 5: Show Only the Outer Spines

In this step, we will remove the spines for the inner subplots and only show the outer spines. This will make the plot look cleaner.

```python
for ax in fig.get_axes():
    ss = ax.get_subplotspec()
    ax.spines.top.set_visible(ss.is_first_row())
    ax.spines.bottom.set_visible(ss.is_last_row())
    ax.spines.left.set_visible(ss.is_first_col())
    ax.spines.right.set_visible(ss.is_last_col())
```

### Step 6: Display the Plot

Finally, we will display the plot using the `show()` function.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use nested `.GridSpec`s in Matplotlib to create a grid of subplots with varying sizes. We also learned how to generate data using `numpy` and how to customize the spines of the subplots. With this knowledge, you can create complex layouts of plots with precise control over their size and spacing.
