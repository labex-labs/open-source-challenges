# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use nested `.GridSpec`s in Matplotlib to create a grid of subplots with varying sizes. This is useful when you want to create a complex layout of plots and have control over the size and spacing of each plot.

> You can open the `demo-gridspec06.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
