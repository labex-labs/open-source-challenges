# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use nested `.GridSpec`s in Matplotlib to create a grid of subplots with varying sizes. This is useful when you want to create a complex layout of plots and have control over the size and spacing of each plot.

> You can write code in `demo-gridspec06.ipynb`.
