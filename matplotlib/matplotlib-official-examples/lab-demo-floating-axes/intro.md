# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `floating_axes` module of Matplotlib to create custom plots with non-rectangular shapes. This module is useful when we need to plot data on non-Cartesian coordinate systems, such as polar or logarithmic plots. We will demonstrate how to create a scatter plot, a bar plot, and a sector plot using different coordinate systems.
