# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `floating_axes` module of Matplotlib to create custom plots with non-rectangular shapes. We created a scatter plot, a bar plot, and a sector plot using different coordinate systems. We used `GridHelperCurveLinear` to create the necessary transformations, `FixedLocator` and `MaxNLocator` to set the grid lines, and `DictFormatter` and `FormatterHMS` to format the tick labels.
