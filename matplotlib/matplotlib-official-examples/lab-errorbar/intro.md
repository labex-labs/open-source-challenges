# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the basic usage of the `errorbar()` function in Matplotlib. The `errorbar()` function is used to plot error bars on a graph. Error bars indicate the variability or uncertainty of a data point in a graph. The function can be used to plot error bars in both the x- and y-directions.
