# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create scatter plots on a polar axis using Matplotlib in Python. We generated random data, created scatter plots on a polar axis, created scatter plots on a polar axis with an offset origin, and created scatter plots on a polar axis confined to a sector. Polar plots are useful for displaying cyclical or circular data, such as data measured over time or direction.
