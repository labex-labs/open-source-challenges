# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create scatter plots on a polar axis using Matplotlib in Python. A polar plot is a graphical representation of data that is displayed in polar coordinates. It is useful when the data is cyclical or circular in nature, such as data measured over time or direction.
