# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It can be used to create a variety of different types of plots and charts. One of the functions provided by Matplotlib is `matshow()`, which can be used to visualize a 2D matrix or array as a color-coded image. In this lab, we will go through the steps to use `matshow()` to visualize a 2D array.

You can open the `matshow.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
