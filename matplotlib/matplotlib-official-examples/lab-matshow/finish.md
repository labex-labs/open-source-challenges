# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to use `matshow()` in Matplotlib to visualize a 2D array as a color-coded image. We first imported the required libraries, then created a 2D array using NumPy, and finally used `matshow()` to visualize the array. By interpreting the visualization, we can gain insights into the values and structure of the 2D array.
