# Interpret the Visualization

In the visualization generated by `matshow()`, each value in the 2D array is represented by a color. The color map used by default in Matplotlib is a gradient from blue to red, with blue representing the lowest values and red representing the highest values. In this particular visualization, the diagonal of the matrix is white, which indicates that the values on the diagonal are the highest in the matrix.
