# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of generating thumbnails from existing images using Matplotlib library in Python. Thumbnails are smaller versions of images that can be used to display a preview of the larger image. Matplotlib depends on Pillow library for reading images and supports all formats supported by Pillow.

> You can write code in `image-thumbnail-sgskip.ipynb`.
