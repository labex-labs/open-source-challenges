# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about rasterization for vector graphics. Rasterization is a process of converting vector graphics into a raster image (pixels). It can speed up rendering and produce smaller files for large data sets, but comes at the cost of a fixed resolution. We will be using Python Matplotlib library to illustrate the concept of rasterization.

> You can write code in `rasterization-demo.ipynb`.
