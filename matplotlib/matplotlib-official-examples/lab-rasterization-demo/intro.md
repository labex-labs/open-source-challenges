# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about rasterization for vector graphics. Rasterization is a process of converting vector graphics into a raster image (pixels). It can speed up rendering and produce smaller files for large data sets, but comes at the cost of a fixed resolution. We will be using Python Matplotlib library to illustrate the concept of rasterization.

> You can open the `rasterization-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
