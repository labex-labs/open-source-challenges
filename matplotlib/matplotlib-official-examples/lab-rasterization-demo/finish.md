# Summary

In this lab, we learned about rasterization for vector graphics. We used Python Matplotlib library to illustrate the concept of rasterization. We created a figure with four subplots to illustrate the different aspects of rasterization. We also learned how rasterization can speed up rendering and produce smaller files for large data sets, but comes at the cost of a fixed resolution. We also learned how rasterization can enable vector graphics to maintain the advantages of vector graphics for some artists such as the axes and text.
