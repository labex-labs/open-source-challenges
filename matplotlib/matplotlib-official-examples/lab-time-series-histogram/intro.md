# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to efficiently visualize large numbers of time series in a way that could potentially reveal hidden substructure and patterns that are not immediately obvious and display them in a visually appealing way.

> You can open the `time-series-histogram.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
