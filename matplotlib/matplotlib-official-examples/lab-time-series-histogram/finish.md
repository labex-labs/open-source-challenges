# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to efficiently visualize large numbers of time series in a way that could potentially reveal hidden substructure and patterns that are not immediately obvious and display them in a visually appealing way. We generated multiple sinusoidal "signal" series that are buried under a larger number of random walk "noise/background" series, and we visualized the data with a line plot and 2D histogram with log and linear color scales.
