# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to generate a shaded and power-normalized rendering of the Mandelbrot set using Python's Matplotlib library. We accomplished this by defining a function to generate the set, normalizing the data, and creating a plot using the normalized data. This technique can be applied to other data sets to create visually appealing and informative images.
