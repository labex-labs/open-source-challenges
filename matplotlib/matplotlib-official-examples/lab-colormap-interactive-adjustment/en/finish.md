# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use Matplotlib to interactively adjust the range of colormapping on an image using a colorbar. You used the zoom and pan mode to adjust the vmin and vmax of the norm. Zooming using the right mouse button expanded the vmin and vmax proportionally to the selected region. When panning, the vmin and vmax of the norm were both shifted according to the direction of movement. You also learned how to add a colorbar to the plot and display the plot.
