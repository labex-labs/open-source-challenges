# Adjust the Colormap

Now, you can interactively adjust the range of colormapping on the image using the colorbar. You can zoom or pan by clicking inside the colorbar. When zooming, the bounding box of the zoom region defines the new vmin and vmax of the norm. Zooming using the right mouse button will expand the vmin and vmax proportionally to the selected region. When panning, the vmin and vmax of the norm are both shifted according to the direction of movement.
