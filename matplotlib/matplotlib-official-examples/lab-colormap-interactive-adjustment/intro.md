# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to interactively adjust the range of colormapping on an image using a colorbar. You will use the zoom and pan mode to adjust the vmin and vmax of the norm. Zooming using the right mouse button will expand the vmin and vmax proportionally to the selected region. When panning, the vmin and vmax of the norm are both shifted according to the direction of movement. You can also use the Home/Back/Forward buttons to get back to a previous state.

You can open the `colormap-interactive-adjustment.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
