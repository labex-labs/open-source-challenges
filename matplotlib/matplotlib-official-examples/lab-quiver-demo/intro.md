# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that allows users to create a wide range of 2D and 3D plots. One of the many useful features of Matplotlib is the ability to create quiver plots, which display vector fields.

This lab will walk through some advanced options for the `quiver()` and `quiverkey()` functions in Matplotlib. These functions allow for customization of the arrows in a quiver plot, including arrow scale, pivot point, and arrow frequency.

> You can write code in `quiver-demo.ipynb`.
