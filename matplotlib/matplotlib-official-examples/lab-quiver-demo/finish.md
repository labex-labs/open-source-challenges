# Summary

This lab covered some advanced options for the `quiver()` and `quiverkey()` functions in Matplotlib. These options allow for customization of the arrows in a quiver plot, including arrow scale, pivot point, and arrow frequency. By using these options, users can create more informative and visually appealing quiver plots.
