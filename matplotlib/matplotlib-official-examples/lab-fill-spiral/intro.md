# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Python and Matplotlib to create a fill spiral plot. We will use the `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries to generate the plot.

> You can open the `fill-spiral.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
