# Fill Spiral Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, we will use Python and Matplotlib to create a fill spiral plot. We will use the `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries to generate the plot.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import libraries

We will import the necessary libraries to generate the plot. We will use `numpy` for numerical calculations and `matplotlib.pyplot` for creating the plot.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Define variables

We will define the variables `theta`, `a`, and `b` for our plot.

```python
theta = np.arange(0, 8*np.pi, 0.1)
a = 1
b = .2
```

### Step 3: Generate the plot

We will generate the plot by looping through four values of `dt` and concatenating the resulting `x` and `y` arrays.

```python
for dt in np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, np.pi/2.0):

    x = a*np.cos(theta + dt)*np.exp(b*theta)
    y = a*np.sin(theta + dt)*np.exp(b*theta)

    dt = dt + np.pi/4.0

    x2 = a*np.cos(theta + dt)*np.exp(b*theta)
    y2 = a*np.sin(theta + dt)*np.exp(b*theta)

    xf = np.concatenate((x, x2[::-1]))
    yf = np.concatenate((y, y2[::-1]))

    p1 = plt.fill(xf, yf)

plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Interpretation

The plot generated by the code shows a spiral that is filled with color. The `a` and `b` variables control the shape of the spiral, while the `theta` variable controls the number of revolutions. The loop through `dt` allows us to create a spiral with four "arms" by rotating the plot by 45 degrees each time.

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Python and Matplotlib to generate a fill spiral plot. We defined variables for the plot, generated the plot using a loop, and interpreted the resulting plot. With this knowledge, we can create similar plots with different shapes and colors.
