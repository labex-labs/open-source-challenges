# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a 3D wireframe plot using Matplotlib. We used the `rstride` and `cstride` parameters to control the density of the lines in the plot. We created a figure with two subplots and used the `plot_wireframe()` method to create the wireframe plot in each subplot. Finally, we showed the plot using the `show()` method.
