# Introduction

This lab is designed to show you how to create a 3D wireframe plot in Python using Matplotlib. A wireframe plot is a visual representation of a three-dimensional surface that displays the structure of the surface using lines. In this lab, we will show how to set the `rstride` and `cstride` parameters to control the density of the lines in the plot.

> You can write code in `wire3d-zero-stride.ipynb`.
