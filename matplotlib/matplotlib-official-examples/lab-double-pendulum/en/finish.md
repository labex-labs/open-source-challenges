# Summary

In this lab, we used Python and Matplotlib to simulate the motion of a double pendulum. We set up the parameters for our simulation, defined a function to calculate the derivatives of the system, integrated the ODE using Euler's method, calculated the position of each pendulum at each time step, and created an animation of the motion of the double pendulum.
