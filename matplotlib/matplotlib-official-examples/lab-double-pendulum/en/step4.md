# Set Up Initial Conditions and Integrate the ODE

We will now set up the initial conditions for our simulation. We will set the initial angles and angular velocities of each pendulum, as well as the time interval for the simulation. We will then integrate the ODE using Euler's method to get the position and velocity of each pendulum at each time step.

```python
# create a time array from 0..t_stop sampled at 0.02 second steps
dt = 0.01
t = np.arange(0, t_stop, dt)

# th1 and th2 are the initial angles (degrees)
# w10 and w20 are the initial angular velocities (degrees per second)
th1 = 120.0
w1 = 0.0
th2 = -10.0
w2 = 0.0

# initial state
state = np.radians([th1, w1, th2, w2])

# integrate the ODE using Euler's method
y = np.empty((len(t), 4))
y[0] = state
for i in range(1, len(t)):
    y[i] = y[i - 1] + derivs(t[i - 1], y[i - 1]) * dt
```
