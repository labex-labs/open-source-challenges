# Set Up Parameters

Next, we will define the parameters for our simulation. These parameters include the acceleration due to gravity, the length and mass of each pendulum, and the time interval for the simulation.

```python
G = 9.8  # acceleration due to gravity, in m/s^2
L1 = 1.0  # length of pendulum 1 in m
L2 = 1.0  # length of pendulum 2 in m
L = L1 + L2  # maximal length of the combined pendulum
M1 = 1.0  # mass of pendulum 1 in kg
M2 = 1.0  # mass of pendulum 2 in kg
t_stop = 2.5  # how many seconds to simulate
history_len = 500  # how many trajectory points to display
```
