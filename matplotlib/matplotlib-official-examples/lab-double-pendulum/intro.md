# Introduction

The double pendulum is a classic problem in physics and mathematics. It involves two pendulums attached to each other, and the motion of the second pendulum is affected by the motion of the first pendulum. In this lab, we will use Python and Matplotlib to simulate the motion of a double pendulum.
