# Set the x and y Units for the Bar Graph

In this step, we will set the x and y units for the bar graph using various keywords. We will use the `xunits` and `yunits` parameters to set the x and y units to centimeters and inches.

```python
axs[0, 1].bar(cms, cms, bottom=bottom, width=width, xunits=cm, yunits=inch)
```
