# Matplotlib Plot Sharing

## Introduction

When creating multiple plots that share a common axis, you may want to ensure that when you zoom in or out on one plot, the other plots update as well. In this lab, we will explore how to use the `sharex` and `sharey` attributes in Matplotlib to create plots that share an axis.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

The first step is to import the required libraries. In this example, we will be using `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Create Data

Next, we need to create some data to plot. In this example, we will create two sets of data, `sin(2*pi*t)` and `sin(4*pi*t)`.

```python
t = np.arange(0, 10, 0.01)
```

### Step 3: Create the First Plot

Now, let's create the first plot using `subplot`. `subplot` takes three arguments: the number of rows, the number of columns, and the plot number. In this example, we will create a plot with 2 rows and 1 column (`211`), which means the first plot will be in the top row.

```python
ax1 = plt.subplot(211)
ax1.plot(t, np.sin(2*np.pi*t))
```

### Step 4: Create the Second Plot

Next, we will create the second plot. We will use `subplot` again, but this time we will set the `sharex` attribute to the first plot (`ax1`). This ensures that the second plot will share the same x-axis as the first plot.

```python
ax2 = plt.subplot(212, sharex=ax1)
ax2.plot(t, np.sin(4*np.pi*t))
```

### Step 5: Show the Plots

Finally, we can show the plots using `plt.show()`.

```python
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `sharex` and `sharey` attributes in Matplotlib to create plots that share a common axis. This is useful when creating multiple plots that represent the same data with different views. By sharing the axis, we can ensure that the plots stay in sync when zooming or panning.
