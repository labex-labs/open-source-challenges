# Introduction

When creating multiple plots that share a common axis, you may want to ensure that when you zoom in or out on one plot, the other plots update as well. In this lab, we will explore how to use the `sharex` and `sharey` attributes in Matplotlib to create plots that share an axis.

> You can write code in `share-axis-lims-views.ipynb`.
