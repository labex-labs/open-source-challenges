# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `sharex` and `sharey` attributes in Matplotlib to create plots that share a common axis. This is useful when creating multiple plots that represent the same data with different views. By sharing the axis, we can ensure that the plots stay in sync when zooming or panning.
