# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Matplotlib to create different types of plots including line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts. We also learned how to customize our plots by adding titles, axis labels, and changing the color and style of the lines. Matplotlib is a powerful library for data visualization and is an essential tool for anyone working with data in Python.
