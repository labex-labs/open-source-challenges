# Customizing the Plot

Now that we have created a basic plot, let's customize it to make it more visually appealing. We can add a title, axis labels, and change the color and style of the line.

```python
# Add title and axis labels
plt.title('Sin Wave')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')

# Change color and style of line
plt.plot(x, y, color='red', linestyle='dashed')
plt.show()
```
