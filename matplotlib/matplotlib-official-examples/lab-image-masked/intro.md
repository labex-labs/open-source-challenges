# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Matplotlib to create visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is a powerful library for data visualization and is commonly used to create plots, charts, and graphs. We will explore the different types of plots available in Matplotlib and learn how to customize them to create professional-looking visualizations.

You can open the `image-masked.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
