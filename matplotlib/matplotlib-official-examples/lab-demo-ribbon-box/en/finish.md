# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a ribbon box chart using Matplotlib. We created the `RibbonBox` and `RibbonBoxImage` classes to create the gradient colors and the actual ribbon boxes, respectively. We then used these classes to create the chart, which consists of ribbon boxes stacked on top of each other to form a bar chart.
