# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Matplotlib's internal LaTeX parser and layout engine to create math text. We will be using Python programming language to write the code.

> You can open the `mathtext-demo.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
