# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a 3D plot with 2D bar graphs projected onto different planes. We will use the Matplotlib library in Python to generate the visualizations. This lab assumes a basic understanding of Python syntax and the Matplotlib library.

> You can open the `bars3d.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
