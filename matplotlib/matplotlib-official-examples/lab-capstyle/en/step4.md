# Interpretation

After running the code, a plot will be displayed with the different `CapStyle` options. The following `CapStyle` options will be displayed:

- `CapStyle.butt`
- `CapStyle.round`
- `CapStyle.projecting`

The `butt` option is the default style, which simply draws a straight line to the end of the segment. The `round` option draws a semi-circle at the end of the segment. The `projecting` option draws a half-square at the end of the segment.
