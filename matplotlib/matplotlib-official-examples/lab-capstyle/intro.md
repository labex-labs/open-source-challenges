# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the `CapStyle` parameter in Matplotlib. This parameter controls how Matplotlib draws the corners where two different line segments meet. We will go through a step-by-step process to understand the different `CapStyle` options and how to implement them.

> You can write code in `capstyle.ipynb`.
