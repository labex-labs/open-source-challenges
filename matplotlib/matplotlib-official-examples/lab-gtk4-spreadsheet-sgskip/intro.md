# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to embed Matplotlib in a Gtk4 application and interact with a treeview to store data. You will be able to plot data by double-clicking on an entry in the treeview.

> You can open the `gtk4-spreadsheet-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
