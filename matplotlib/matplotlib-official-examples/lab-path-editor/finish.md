# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create an interactive plot that allows us to edit a path by dragging markers on the plot. We used the Matplotlib library to create the plot and handle events, and created a custom class to handle the event callbacks. By following these steps, you can create your own interactive plots with Matplotlib.
