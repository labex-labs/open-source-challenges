# Introduction

This lab will guide you through an example of a cross-GUI application using Matplotlib event handling to interact with and modify objects on the canvas. You will learn how to edit a path on a plot, by dragging markers with the mouse, and toggling their visibility.

> You can write code in `path-editor.ipynb`.
