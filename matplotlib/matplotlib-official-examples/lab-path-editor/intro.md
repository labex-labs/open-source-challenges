# Introduction

This lab will guide you through an example of a cross-GUI application using Matplotlib event handling to interact with and modify objects on the canvas. You will learn how to edit a path on a plot, by dragging markers with the mouse, and toggling their visibility.

You can open the `path-editor.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
