# Introduction

In data visualization, contour plots are commonly used to display 3-dimensional data on a 2-dimensional plane. Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library in Python that provides functionalities to create different types of plots, including contour plots. In this lab, we will learn how to create masked contour plots using Matplotlib and how to illustrate the difference between corner masks being enabled and disabled.
