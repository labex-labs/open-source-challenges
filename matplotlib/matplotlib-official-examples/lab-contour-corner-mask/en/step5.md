# Interpretation of Results

In this step, we will interpret the results of the masked contour plot. We can observe that the `corner_mask` parameter controls whether or not the corner points of the plot are masked. When `corner_mask` is set to `True`, the corners of the contour plot are masked, while when it is set to `False`, they are not masked. We can also see that the masked points are indicated by red circles.
