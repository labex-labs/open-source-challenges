# Importing Required Libraries

To create masked contour plots using Matplotlib, we need to import the following libraries:

- `numpy`: a library for the Python programming language that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: a collection of functions that provide a simple interface for creating different types of plots.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
