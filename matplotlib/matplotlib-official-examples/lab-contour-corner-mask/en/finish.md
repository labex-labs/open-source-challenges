# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create masked contour plots using Matplotlib. We first imported the required libraries and then created the data to plot. We then masked some of the `z` values using a Boolean mask, and created the contour plot using the `contourf()` function. Finally, we interpreted the results and observed the difference between corner masks being enabled and disabled.
