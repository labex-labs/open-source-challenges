# Introduction

Pie charts are popular data visualization tools used to represent data in a circular form. However, there are times when you might want to create a nested version of the pie chart, known as the donut chart. This tutorial will guide you through creating nested pie charts using Matplotlib, a popular data visualization library in Python.

You can open the `nested-pie.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
