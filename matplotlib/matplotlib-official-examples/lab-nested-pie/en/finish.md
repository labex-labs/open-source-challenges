# Summary

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create nested pie charts in Matplotlib using two methods: `ax.pie` and `ax.bar`. We have also learned how to customize the nested pie chart by adding labels, changing colors, and adjusting the size. Finally, we have seen how to save the nested pie chart as an image in png, pdf, or svg format.
