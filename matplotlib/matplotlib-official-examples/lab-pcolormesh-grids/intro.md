# Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for Python. It provides a variety of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, we will learn how to use `pcolormesh` and `pcolor` functions in Matplotlib to visualize 2D grids.

> You can open the `pcolormesh-grids.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
