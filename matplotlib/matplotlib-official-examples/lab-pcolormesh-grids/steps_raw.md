# Step-by-Step Lab: Pcolormesh Grids and Shading

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for Python. It provides a variety of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this lab, we will learn how to use `pcolormesh` and `pcolor` functions in Matplotlib to visualize 2D grids.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

First, we need to import the required libraries, Matplotlib and NumPy, by running the following code block:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Create Data for Visualization

Next, we will create a 2D grid that we will use for visualization. We can create a grid using the `meshgrid` function in NumPy. The `meshgrid` function creates a grid of points given two vectors, `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of the grid points. We will create a grid of 5x5 points using the following code block:

```python
nrows = 5
ncols = 5
x = np.arange(ncols + 1)
y = np.arange(nrows + 1)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = X + Y
```

### Step 3: Flat Shading

The `pcolormesh` function in Matplotlib can visualize 2D grids. The grid specification with the least assumptions is `shading='flat'` and if the grid is one larger than the data in each dimension, i.e., has shape `(M+1, N+1)`. In that case, `X` and `Y` specify the corners of quadrilaterals that are colored with the values in `Z`. We can visualize the grid using the following code block:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pcolormesh(X, Y, Z, shading='flat', cmap='viridis')
ax.set_title('Flat Shading')
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Flat Shading, Same Shape Grid

If the grid is the same shape as the data in each dimension, we cannot use `shading='flat'`. Historically, Matplotlib silently dropped the last row and column of `Z` in this case, to match Matlab's behavior. If this behavior is still desired, simply drop the last row and column manually. We can visualize the grid using the following code block:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pcolormesh(x, y, Z[:-1, :-1], shading='flat', cmap='viridis')
ax.set_title('Flat Shading, Same Shape Grid')
plt.show()
```

### Step 5: Nearest Shading, Same Shape Grid

Usually, dropping a row and column of data is not what the user means when they make `X`, `Y`, and `Z` all the same shape. For this case, Matplotlib allows `shading='nearest'` and centers the colored quadrilaterals on the grid points. If a grid that is not the correct shape is passed with `shading='nearest'`, an error is raised. We can visualize the grid using the following code block:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pcolormesh(X, Y, Z, shading='nearest', cmap='viridis')
ax.set_title('Nearest Shading, Same Shape Grid')
plt.show()
```

### Step 6: Auto Shading

It's possible that the user would like the code to automatically choose which to use, in this case, `shading='auto'` will decide whether to use `flat` or `nearest` shading based on the shapes of `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. We can visualize the grid using the following code block:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pcolormesh(x, y, Z, shading='auto', cmap='viridis')
ax.set_title('Auto Shading')
plt.show()
```

### Step 7: Gouraud Shading

`Gouraud shading` can also be specified, where the color in the quadrilaterals is linearly interpolated between the grid points. The shapes of `X`, `Y`, `Z` must be the same. We can visualize the grid using the following code block:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pcolormesh(X, Y, Z, shading='gouraud', cmap='viridis')
ax.set_title('Gouraud Shading')
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use `pcolormesh` and `pcolor` functions in Matplotlib to visualize 2D grids. We learned about different shading options, including `flat`, `nearest`, `auto`, and `gouraud`. We also learned how to create a 2D grid using the `meshgrid` function in NumPy.
