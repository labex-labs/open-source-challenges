# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to plot a parametric curve in 3D using Matplotlib. The curve will be defined by three equations:

x = r \* sin(theta)

y = r \* cos(theta)

z = z

where r and z are defined as:

r = z^2 + 1

z is a range of values from -2 to 2, and theta is a range of values from -4π to 4π.
