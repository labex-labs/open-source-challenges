# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to customize box plots in Matplotlib. Box plots are a popular way to visualize the distribution of a dataset. They are also known as box-and-whisker plots and show the median, quartiles, and outliers of the data. We will go through various examples to learn how to customize box plots using Matplotlib.
