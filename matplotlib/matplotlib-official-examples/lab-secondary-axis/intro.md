# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. Sometimes, we need to plot two different scales of data on the same graph, this is when the concept of a secondary axis comes into play. In this lab, we will learn how to create a secondary axis in Matplotlib.

> You can write code in `secondary-axis.ipynb`.
