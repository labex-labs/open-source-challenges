# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to add hatches to most polygons in Matplotlib, including Axes.bar, Axes.fill_between, Axes.contourf, and children of patches.Polygon. You learned how to create different hatching patterns, repeat them to increase density, and combine them to create additional patterns. You also learned how to use the add_patch() function to add a Rectangle object to an axis and how to use the text() function to add text to the plot.
