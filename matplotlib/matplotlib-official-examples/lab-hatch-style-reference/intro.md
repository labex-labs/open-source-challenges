# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of adding hatches to most polygons in Matplotlib, including Axes.bar, Axes.fill_between, Axes.contourf, and children of patches.Polygon. You will learn how to create different hatching patterns, repeat them to increase density, and combine them to create additional patterns.

> You can write code in `hatch-style-reference.ipynb`.
