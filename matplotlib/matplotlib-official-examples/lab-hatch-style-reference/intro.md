# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of adding hatches to most polygons in Matplotlib, including Axes.bar, Axes.fill_between, Axes.contourf, and children of patches.Polygon. You will learn how to create different hatching patterns, repeat them to increase density, and combine them to create additional patterns.

> You can open the `hatch-style-reference.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
