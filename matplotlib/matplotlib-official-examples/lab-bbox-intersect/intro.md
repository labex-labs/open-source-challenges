# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to change the colors of lines intersecting a rectangle using the `.intersects_bbox` function from Matplotlib. We will create a rectangle and generate random lines that intersect it. Then, we will change the color of the intersecting lines to red and the remaining lines to blue.

You can open the `bbox-intersect.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
