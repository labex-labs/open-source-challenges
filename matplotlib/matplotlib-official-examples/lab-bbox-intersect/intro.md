# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to change the colors of lines intersecting a rectangle using the `.intersects_bbox` function from Matplotlib. We will create a rectangle and generate random lines that intersect it. Then, we will change the color of the intersecting lines to red and the remaining lines to blue.

> You can write code in `bbox-intersect.ipynb`.
