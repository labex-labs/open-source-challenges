# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to change the colors of lines intersecting a rectangle using the `.intersects_bbox` function from Matplotlib. We created a rectangle and generated random lines that intersected it. Then, we changed the color of the intersecting lines to red and the remaining lines to blue.
