# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using Matplotlib to grab individual frames from a movie and write them to a file. This method is useful for generating animations and can be done without event loop integration.

> You can open the `frame-grabbing-sgskip.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
