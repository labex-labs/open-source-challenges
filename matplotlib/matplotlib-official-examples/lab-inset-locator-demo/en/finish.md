# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `.inset_locator` feature in Matplotlib to create insets in plots. We created insets with different sizes and locations, controlled the inset position and size, and created insets with arbitrary positions. We also created insets outside the axes, insets with 2-tuple bounding boxes, and insets centered in figure coordinates.
