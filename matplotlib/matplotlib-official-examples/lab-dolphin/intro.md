# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of drawing and manipulating shapes using the `matplotlib.path.Path`, `matplotlib.patches.PathPatch`, and `matplotlib.transforms` classes. You will learn how to create a plot with a circle, a dolphin shape, and a dolphin shape rotated by 60 degrees.

> You can open the `dolphin.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
