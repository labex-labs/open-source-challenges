# Summary

In this tutorial, you have learned how to create a plot with a circle, a dolphin shape, and a dolphin shape rotated by 60 degrees. You have used the `matplotlib.path.Path`, `matplotlib.patches.PathPatch`, and `matplotlib.transforms` classes to draw and manipulate shapes in the plot. You can now use this knowledge to create more complex shapes and plots.
