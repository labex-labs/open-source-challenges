  "description": "In this lab, we will learn how to create and plot unstructured triangular grids in Python using the Matplotlib library. We will start by creating a Delaunay triangulation of a set of points and then plot the triangulation. Next, we will specify our own triangulation by providing the indices of the three points that make up each triangle. Finally, we will plot the user-specified triangulation.",
