In this step-by-step lab, we will be learning how to create a simple axis direction in Python Matplotlib. Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that allows you to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python programming. We will be using the library to create a simple axis direction diagram using the following steps.
