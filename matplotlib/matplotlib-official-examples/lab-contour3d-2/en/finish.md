# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. We used the `contour()` function to create level curves, and the `extend3d=True` option to extend the curves vertically into 'ribbons'. We also used the `get_test_data()` function to generate sample data, and the `cm.coolwarm` colormap for a nice color scheme.
