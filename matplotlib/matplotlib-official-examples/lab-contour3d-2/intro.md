# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a 3D contour plot using Matplotlib in Python. The contour plot represents a 3D surface using contours or level curves. We will use the `contour()` function to create these level curves, and the `extend3d=True` option to extend the curves vertically into 'ribbons'.
