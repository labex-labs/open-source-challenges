# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use text commands to add text and annotations to our plots. We explored different ways to add text and annotations to our plots using the `ax.text()` and `ax.annotate()` functions. We also learned how to set the limits of the plot using the `ax.set()` function. By using these text commands, we can make our plots more informative and easier to understand.
