# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used to create visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and more. In this lab, we will learn how to use text commands to add text to our plots. We will explore different ways to add text and annotations to our plots.

> You can write code in `text-commands.ipynb`.
