# Introduction

In this lab, we will create a pie and a donut chart using Python's Matplotlib library. We will learn how to label them with a legend as well as with annotations.

You can open the `pie-and-donut-labels.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
