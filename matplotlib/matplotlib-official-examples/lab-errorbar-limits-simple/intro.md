# Introduction

In data visualization, it is often necessary to show the degree of uncertainty in the data being plotted. Error bars are a convenient way to represent this uncertainty. In this lab, we will learn how to selectively draw lower and/or upper limit symbols on error bars using the parameters `uplims` and `lolims` in Matplotlib.
