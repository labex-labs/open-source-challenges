# Summary

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the RGBAxes module of the AxesGrid toolkit in Matplotlib to display RGB channels. We have covered the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries
2. Define a function to get RGB channels
3. Define a function to create a RGB cube
4. Create a RGBAxes plot
5. Create a RGBAxes plot with separate channels
6. Display the plots.
