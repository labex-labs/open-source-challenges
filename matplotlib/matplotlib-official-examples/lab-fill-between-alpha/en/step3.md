# Highlighting Certain Regions with `where`

The `where` keyword argument is very handy for highlighting certain regions of the graph. `where` takes a boolean mask the same length as the x, ymin and ymax arguments, and only fills in the region where the boolean mask is True. In the example below, we simulate a single random walker and compute the analytic mean and standard deviation of the population positions. The population mean is shown as the dashed line, and the plus/minus one sigma deviation from the mean is shown as the filled region. We use the where mask `X > upper_bound` to find the region where the walker is outside the one sigma boundary, and shade that region red.

```python
# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(1)

Nsteps = 500
t = np.arange(Nsteps)

mu = 0.002
sigma = 0.01

# the steps and position
S = mu + sigma*np.random.randn(Nsteps)
X = S.cumsum()

# the 1 sigma upper and lower analytic population bounds
lower_bound = mu*t - sigma*np.sqrt(t)
upper_bound = mu*t + sigma*np.sqrt(t)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
ax.plot(t, X, lw=2, label='walker position')
ax.plot(t, mu*t, lw=1, label='population mean', color='C0', ls='--')
ax.fill_between(t, lower_bound, upper_bound, facecolor='C0', alpha=0.4,
                label='1 sigma range')
ax.legend(loc='upper left')

# here we use the where argument to only fill the region where the
# walker is above the population 1 sigma boundary
ax.fill_between(t, upper_bound, X, where=X > upper_bound, fc='red', alpha=0.4)
ax.fill_between(t, lower_bound, X, where=X < lower_bound, fc='red', alpha=0.4)
ax.set_xlabel('num steps')
ax.set_ylabel('position')
ax.grid()
```
