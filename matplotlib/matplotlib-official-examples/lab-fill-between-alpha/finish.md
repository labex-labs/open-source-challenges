# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `fill_between` function and the `alpha` argument in Matplotlib to create more visually appealing and informative graphs. We demonstrated several examples of using `fill_between` and `alpha` to highlight certain regions or ranges of a graph. We also briefly introduced the `axhspan` and `axvspan` functions for highlighting spans of an Axes.
