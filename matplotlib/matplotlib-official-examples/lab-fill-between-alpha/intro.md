# Introduction

In data visualization, sometimes it is necessary to highlight certain areas or ranges on a graph. The `fill_between` function of Matplotlib is a useful tool for generating a shaded region between a minimum and maximum boundary. It can also be used to enhance the visual appearance of a graph. The `alpha` argument can be used to adjust the transparency of the shaded region. This lab will guide you through several examples of using `fill_between` and `alpha` in Matplotlib to create more visually appealing and informative graphs.

> You can write code in `fill-between-alpha.ipynb`.
