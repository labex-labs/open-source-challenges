# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the `matplotlib` library to create colorbars for visualizations. Colorbars are a useful tool to help interpret visualizations, by providing a color scale that corresponds to the data being plotted. We will use `matplotlib` to create colorbars for visualizations with both positive and negative data values.
