# Import necessary libraries

First, we need to import necessary libraries such as Matplotlib, NumPy, Matplotlib font manager, and AnchoredDirectionArrows from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1. We will use these libraries to create anchored direction arrows.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import matplotlib.font_manager as fm
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.anchored_artists import AnchoredDirectionArrows
```
