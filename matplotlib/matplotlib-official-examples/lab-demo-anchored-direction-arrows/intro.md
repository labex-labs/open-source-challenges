# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create anchored direction arrows in Matplotlib. Anchored direction arrows are arrows that point in a specific direction and are anchored to a plot. These arrows are useful for indicating specific directions or orientations in a plot. We will learn how to create simple arrows as well as high contrast and rotated arrows.

> You can open the `demo-anchored-direction-arrows.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
