# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create anchored direction arrows in Matplotlib. We created simple arrows as well as high contrast and rotated arrows. We also learned how to alter the arrow directions and aspect ratios. Anchored direction arrows are useful for indicating specific directions or orientations in a plot.
