# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a visualization using Matplotlib with "dropped spines". We used the `set_position()` function to move the left and bottom spines outward and the `set_visible()` function to hide the top and right spines. This technique is useful for improving the clarity and aesthetic of plots.
