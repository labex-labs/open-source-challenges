# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a visualization using Matplotlib with "dropped spines". Dropped spines refers to the visualization technique where the spines of the axes (the lines around the plot) are moved to the outer edges of the plot area.

> You can write code in `spines-dropped.ipynb`.
