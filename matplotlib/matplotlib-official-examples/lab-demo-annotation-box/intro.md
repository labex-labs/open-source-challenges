# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use AnnotationBbox in Matplotlib to annotate figures using text, shapes, and images. AnnotationBbox is a more fine-grained control method than Axes.annotate. We will go through three different OffsetBoxes: TextArea, DrawingArea, and OffsetImage.

> You can write code in `demo-annotation-box.ipynb`.
