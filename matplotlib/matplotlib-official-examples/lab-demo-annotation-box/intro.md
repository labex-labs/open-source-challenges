# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use AnnotationBbox in Matplotlib to annotate figures using text, shapes, and images. AnnotationBbox is a more fine-grained control method than Axes.annotate. We will go through three different OffsetBoxes: TextArea, DrawingArea, and OffsetImage.

> You can open the `demo-annotation-box.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
