# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to use AnnotationBbox in Matplotlib to annotate figures using text, shapes, and images. We have gone through three different OffsetBoxes: TextArea, DrawingArea, and OffsetImage. By using AnnotationBbox, we have more fine-grained control over annotations than using Axes.annotate.
