# Summary

Congratulations! You have learned how to create plots with different scales in Python using Matplotlib. Specifically, you have learned how to create two plots on the same axes with different left and right scales by using two different axes that share the same x-axis. You can use separate `matplotlib.ticker` formatters and locators as desired since the two axes are independent.
