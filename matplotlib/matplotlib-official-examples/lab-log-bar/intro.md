# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a logarithmic bar chart using Python Matplotlib library. A logarithmic bar chart is useful when the values of the dataset are very different in size, and we want to visualize them in a more balanced way.

> You can open the `log-bar.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
