# Defining the Data

Next, we need to define the data that we want to use for our bar chart. In this example, we will be using a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains two values. The first value represents the x-axis value, and the second value represents the y-axis value.

```python
data = ((3, 1000), (10, 3), (100, 30), (500, 800), (50, 1))
```
