# Importing Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries. In this case, we will be using the `matplotlib.pyplot` and `numpy` libraries. The `pyplot` library will allow us to create our bar chart, and the `numpy` library will help us to manipulate the data.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
