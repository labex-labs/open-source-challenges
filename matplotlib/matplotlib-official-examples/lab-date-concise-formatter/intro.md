# Introduction

The `~.dates.ConciseDateFormatter` is a useful tool for formatting date ticks when working with Matplotlib. In this lab, you will learn how to use this formatter to improve the strings chosen for the tick labels and to minimize the strings used in those tick labels as much as possible.

> You can open the `date-concise-formatter.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
