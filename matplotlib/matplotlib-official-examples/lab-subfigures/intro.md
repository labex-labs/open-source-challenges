# Introduction

Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating visualizations, such as graphs, charts, and figures. In this lab, you will learn how to create subfigures in Matplotlib. Subfigures are figures that contain two or more plots within the same figure. Subfigures can help you to compare different data sets or to show different views of the same data. They are useful when you want to display multiple plots together.

You can open the `subfigures.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
