# Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to overlay an image on a Matplotlib plot by moving it to the front and making it semi-transparent. The tutorial uses the `figimage` method from the `matplotlib.figure.Figure` class and the `imread` method from the `matplotlib.image` module.

You can open the `watermark-image.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
