# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to interactively select data points with the lasso tool using Python Matplotlib. You will be plotting a scatter plot and then selecting a few points by drawing a lasso loop around the points on the graph. To draw, just click on the graph, hold, and drag it around the points you need to select.

> You can write code in `lasso-selector-demo-sgskip.ipynb`.
