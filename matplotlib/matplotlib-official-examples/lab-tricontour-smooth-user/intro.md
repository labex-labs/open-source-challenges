# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating high-resolution tricontours on user-defined triangular grids using Matplotlib. You will learn how to create a Triangulation, refine data, and plot the triangulation and high-resolution iso-contours.

> You can open the `tricontour-smooth-user.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
