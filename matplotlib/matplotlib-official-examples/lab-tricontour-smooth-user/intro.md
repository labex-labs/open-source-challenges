# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating high-resolution tricontours on user-defined triangular grids using Matplotlib. You will learn how to create a Triangulation, refine data, and plot the triangulation and high-resolution iso-contours.

> You can write code in `tricontour-smooth-user.ipynb`.
