# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to add a crosshair cursor to a Matplotlib plot. You created a simple cursor, a cursor that uses blitting for faster rendering, and a cursor that snaps to data points of a `Line2D` object. These cursors can be useful for exploring data and gaining insights from visualizations.
