# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create an animated histogram using Matplotlib in Python. The animated histogram will simulate new data coming in and update the heights of rectangles with the new data.

> You can open the `animated-histogram.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
