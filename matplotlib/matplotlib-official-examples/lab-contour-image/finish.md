# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create a contour image using Python's Matplotlib library. You started by importing the necessary libraries, defining the data to be plotted, creating the contour image, and displaying the image. The contour image is a useful visualization technique that can be used to represent a three-dimensional surface using a two-dimensional plot.
