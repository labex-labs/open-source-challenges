# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a contour image using Python's Matplotlib library. The contour image is a visualization technique that represents a three-dimensional surface using a two-dimensional plot. The contour image consists of contour lines, which are lines that connect points of equal value in the surface, and filled contours, which are regions between the contour lines.

> You can open the `contour-image.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
