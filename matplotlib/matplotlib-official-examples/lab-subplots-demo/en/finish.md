# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create subplots using Matplotlib. We covered creating a figure with a single subplot, stacking subplots in one direction, stacking subplots in two directions, sharing axes, and creating polar axes. By using these techniques, we can create complex visualizations that allow us to compare and analyze multiple data sets at once.
