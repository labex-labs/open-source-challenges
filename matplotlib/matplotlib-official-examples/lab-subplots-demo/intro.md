# Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It provides a variety of functions to create different types of plots. One of its key features is the ability to create subplots. This allows users to create multiple plots in the same figure, making it easier to compare different data sets or views of the same data. In this lab, we will walk through the process of creating subplots using Matplotlib.
