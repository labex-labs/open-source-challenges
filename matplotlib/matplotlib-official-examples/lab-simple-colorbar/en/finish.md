# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to add a simple colorbar to a Matplotlib plot. We used the `imshow` function to create a 2D plot and then added a colorbar using the `colorbar` function. We also customized the appearance of the colorbar and added a label to it. Colorbars are a useful tool for visualizing the range of values represented by colors in a plot.
