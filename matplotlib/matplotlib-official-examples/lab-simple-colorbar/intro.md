# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to add a simple colorbar to a Matplotlib plot. A colorbar is a useful tool for visualizing the range of values represented by colors in a plot. We will use the `imshow` function to create a simple 2D plot and then add a colorbar to it.

> You can open the `simple-colorbar.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
