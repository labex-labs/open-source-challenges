# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to add a simple colorbar to a Matplotlib plot. A colorbar is a useful tool for visualizing the range of values represented by colors in a plot. We will use the `imshow` function to create a simple 2D plot and then add a colorbar to it.

> You can write code in `simple-colorbar.ipynb`.
