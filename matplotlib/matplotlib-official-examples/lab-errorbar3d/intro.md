# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a 3D plot with error bars using Python's Matplotlib library. Error bars are a graphical representation of the variability of data and are often used in scientific and engineering fields to show uncertainties in measurements or statistical estimates.

> You can write code in `errorbar3d.ipynb`.
