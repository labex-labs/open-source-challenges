# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use different coordinate systems for annotations in Matplotlib. We created a plot, transformed the data and display coordinates, and added annotations to the plot using the `ax.annotate` method. Annotations are an important feature of Matplotlib that allow users to add context and information to their plots.
