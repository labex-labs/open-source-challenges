# Creating a Glade 3 File

Next, we will create a Glade 3 file to create the user interface for our application. Open Glade 3 and create a new project. Add a `ScrolledWindow` widget and a `Window` widget. Name the window `window1` and the scrolled window `scrolledwindow1`. Save the file as `mpl_with_glade3.glade`.
