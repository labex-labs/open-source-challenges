# Summary

Viewing the history of a Git repository can be overwhelming, but using a visual graph can make it much easier to understand. By using the `git log` command with the `--graph` option, you can view a visual representation of all the commits and branches in the repository. This can help you identify any issues or bugs that may have been introduced and understand how the code has evolved over time.
