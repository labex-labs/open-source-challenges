# Summary

Creating a new branch in Git is a simple process that allows you to work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase. Use the `git checkout -b <branch>` command to create a new branch with the specified name and switch to it. You can optionally add `-t <remote>/<branch>` to set up a remote tracking branch for the newly created branch.
