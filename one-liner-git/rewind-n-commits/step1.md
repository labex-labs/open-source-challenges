# Git Challenge: Rewind Commits

## Problem

As a developer, you have been working on a project and have made several commits. However, you realize that the last few commits contain errors and you need to go back to a previous version of your code. You need to use Git to rewind your commits and get back to the previous version of your code.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will need to use the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch called `rewind-commits`.
3. Make some changes to the code and commit them.
4. Make some more changes and commit them again.
5. Realize that the last few commits contain errors and you need to go back to the previous version of your code.
6. Use Git to rewind your commits by 2.
7. Verify that you have successfully rewound your commits by checking the code in your working directory.
8. Push your changes to the `rewind-commits` branch.
