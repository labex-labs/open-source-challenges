# Summary

Renaming a remote branch in Git involves renaming the branch both locally and on the remote. You can use the `git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>` command to rename the local branch and the `git push origin --delete <old-name>` and `git push origin -u <new-name>` commands to delete the old remote branch and set the new remote branch, respectively.
