# View a Short Summary of Commits

Git is a powerful version control system that allows developers to track changes made to their codebase over time. One of the most useful features of Git is the ability to view a summary of all the commits made to a repository. This can be helpful when trying to understand the history of a project or to identify when a particular change was made.
