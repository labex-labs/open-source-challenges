# Summary

Resetting the local `master` branch to match the one on the remote is a common task when working with Git. By following the steps outlined in this challenge, you can ensure that your local branch is up to date with the remote branch. Remember to use `git fetch origin` to retrieve the latest updates from the remote, `git checkout master` to switch to the `master` branch, and `git reset --hard origin/master` to reset the local `master` branch to match the one on the remote.
