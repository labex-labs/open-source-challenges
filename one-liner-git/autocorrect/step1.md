# Autocorrect Git Commands

## Problem

The problem is that developers often mistype git commands, which can lead to errors and slow down their workflow. For example, a developer might accidentally type `git sttaus` instead of `git status`, which will result in an error message. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially when working on large projects with many files and collaborators.

## Example

To demonstrate how to use Git's autocorrect feature, we will use the git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` directory.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Clone the repository using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`
3. Navigate to the cloned repository using the following command: `cd git-playground`
4. Enable Git's autocorrect feature using the following command: `git config --global help.autocorrect 1`
5. Try mistyping a git command, such as `git sttaus`. Git will automatically correct the command and run `git status` instead.
