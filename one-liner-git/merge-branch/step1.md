# Merge a Branch

## Problem

Your task is to merge a branch into the current branch using Git. You will need to switch to the target branch and then merge the source branch into it. This can be useful when you want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch of your project.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will need to use the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Follow these steps to merge the `feature-branch` into the `main` branch:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.
2. Use the command `git checkout main` to switch to the `main` branch.
3. Use the command `git merge feature-branch` to merge the `feature-branch` into the `main` branch.
4. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.
5. Use the command `git push` to push the changes to the remote repository.
