# Configure Line Endings

In Git, line endings are important because they can affect the way your code is displayed and executed. Different operating systems use different line endings, which can cause issues when collaborating on a project. Therefore, it is important to configure the line endings for a repository to ensure consistency and avoid conflicts.
