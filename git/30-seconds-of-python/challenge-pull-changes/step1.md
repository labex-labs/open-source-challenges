# Pull Latest Changes from Remote

## Problem

You are working on a project with a team of developers, and you need to ensure that your local copy of the codebase is up to date with the latest changes made by your team members. To do this, you need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

## Example

For this challenge, we will be using the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Follow the steps below to complete the challenge:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git
```

2. Change into the directory of the cloned repository:

```shell
cd git-playground
```

3. Check the status of the repository using the following command:

```shell
git status
```

4. You should see a message indicating that your local copy of the repository is behind the remote repository. To pull the latest changes from the remote repository, use the following command:

```shell
git pull
```

5. After running the `git pull` command, check the status of the repository again using the `git status` command. You should see a message indicating that your local copy of the repository is up to date with the remote repository.
