# View Commits in a Specific Date Range

Your task is to view all commits in a specific date range using Git. You will need to use the `git log` command with the `--since` and `--until` options to specify the date range. You can use either a specific date or a relative date (e.g. "2 weeks ago").

To complete this challenge, you will need to use the `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` repository. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.
2. Navigate to the repository directory using the command `cd git-playground`.
3. Use the command `git log --since='Apr 1 2023' --until='Apr 4 2023'` to view all commits between April 1, 2023 and April 4, 2023.
4. Use the command `git log --since='2 weeks ago'` to view all commits made in the last two weeks.
