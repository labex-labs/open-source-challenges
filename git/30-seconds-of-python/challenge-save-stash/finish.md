# Summary

Creating a stash in Git allows you to save your changes without committing them, so you can switch to a different branch or work on a different feature. You can then apply your stash later when you're ready to continue working on your changes. Use the `git stash save` command to create a stash, and the `git stash apply` command to apply your stash.
