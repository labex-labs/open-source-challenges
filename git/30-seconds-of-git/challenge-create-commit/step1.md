# Create a Git Commit

## Problem

You have made some changes to your code and want to save them as a snapshot in your Git repository. However, you don't want to save all the changes you made, only the ones that are relevant to the current feature or bug fix. How can you create a commit containing only the relevant changes?

## Example

For this challenge, fork the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` into your GitHub account.To create a commit, you first need to stage the changes you want to include in the commit.Configure your github account in the environment. Let's assume you have cloned the `https://github.com/your-username/git-playground` repository and made some changes to the `README.md` file. Create a commit with the message "Update README.md".

This is the result of running the `git log` command:
