# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to view the "undo" history in Git using the `git reflog` command. The reference log is a record of all the actions you've taken in your repository, including commits, merges, rebases, and resets. By viewing the reference log, you can see a complete history of all the changes you've made to your repository, even if they don't show up in the commit history. This can be especially useful when you need to undo changes that you've made to your codebase.
