# Summary

In this lab, you have learned how to view the difference between two branches using Git. By using the `git diff` command with the branch names separated by two dots, you can compare the changes between the two branches. This feature is useful when you want to merge changes from one branch to another or when you want to see what has been modified between two branches.
