# View Commits in a Specific Date Range

## Problem

Your task is to view all commits in a specific date range using Git. You can use either a specific date or a relative date (e.g. "12 weeks ago").

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will need to use the `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` repository.

1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. View all commits between April 25, 2023 and April 27, 2023.
3. View all commits made in the last twelve weeks.

This is the final result:
```
