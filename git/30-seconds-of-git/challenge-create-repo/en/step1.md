# Create a New Repository

You have been tasked with creating a new Git repository for a project. You need to set up all the configuration files needed by Git and ensure that the repository is properly initialized.

## Tasks

1. Initialize a new Git repository named `my_project` in `~/project`.
2. Verify that the `.git` directory has been created inside the `my_project` directory.

## Example

When you finish the tasks, the `my_project` directory should look like this:

```bash
ls -a ~/project/my_project
```

```plaintext
.  ..  .git
```
