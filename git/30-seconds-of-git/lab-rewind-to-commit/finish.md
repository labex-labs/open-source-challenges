# Summary

Rewinding back to a specific commit is a useful feature of Git that allows developers to undo changes or revert to an earlier version of their code. In this lab, you used Git to rewind back to a specific commit in a repository. Remember to use `git reset` to rewind back to a specific commit and `git reset --hard` to delete changes and revert to an earlier version of your code.
