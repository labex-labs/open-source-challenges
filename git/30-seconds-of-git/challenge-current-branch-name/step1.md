# Get the Current Branch Name

## Problem

Write a command that prints the name of the current branch in a Git repository.

## Example

Suppose you're working on a project stored in the `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` repository. You want to make sure you're on the correct branch.You switch to a different branch, such as `feature-branch`.

This will output:
```shell
feature-branch
```
