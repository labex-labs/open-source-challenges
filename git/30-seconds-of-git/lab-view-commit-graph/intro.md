# View a Visual Graph of the Repository

Git is a powerful tool for version control, allowing developers to track changes to their code over time. One of the most useful features of Git is the ability to visualize the history of a repository using a graph. This graph shows all of the commits and branches in the repository, making it easy to see how the code has evolved over time.
