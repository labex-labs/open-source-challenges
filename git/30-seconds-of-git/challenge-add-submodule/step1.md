# Add a Submodule

## Problem

Your task is to add a new submodule to a Git repository. You will need to add the submodule from an upstream repository to a local directory in your repository.  

## Example

Suppose you have a Git repository and you want to add a submodule from the Git repository `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git` to a directory named `git-playground` in your local repository. This is the result after completing the challenge:

This will create a new directory named `git-playground` in your local repository, which will contain the submodule from the upstream repository.
