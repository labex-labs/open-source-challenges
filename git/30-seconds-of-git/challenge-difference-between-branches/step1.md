# Difference Between Branches

## Problem

You have been working on a project with your team, and you have created a branch named `feature-1` to work on a new feature. Your colleague has also created a branch named `feature-2` to work on a different feature. You want to compare the changes between the two branches to see what has been added, modified, or deleted. How can you view the difference between the two branches?

## Example

Suppose your GitHub account clones a repository called `git-playground` from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.

1. Navigate to the repository directory and configure your GitHub identity .
2. Switch to the `feature-1` branch and add "hello" to the `README.md` file, add it to the staging area and commit, the commit message is "Add new content to README.md".
3. Switch to the `feature-2` branch and add "world" to the `index.html` file, add it to the staging area and commit, the commit message is "Update index.html file".
4. View the difference between the two branches.

The output should display the difference between the `feature-1` and `feature-2` branches.This shows how the final result will look likeï¼š
```shell
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
