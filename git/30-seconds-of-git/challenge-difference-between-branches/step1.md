# Git Challenge: View Difference Between Two Branches

## Problem

You have been working on a project with your team, and you have created a branch named `feature-1` to work on a new feature. Your colleague has also created a branch named `feature-2` to work on a different feature. You want to compare the changes between the two branches to see what has been added, modified, or deleted. How can you view the difference between the two branches?

## Example

Suppose your GitHub account clones a repository called `git-playground` from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Change to the repository's directory.
3. Configure your GitHub account in this environment.
4. Create a new branch named `feature-1`.
5. Make some changes to the `README.md` file using your favorite text editor and commit the changes.
6. Create a new branch named `feature-2`.
7. Make some changes to the `index.html` file using your favorite text editor and commit the changes.
8. View the difference between the two branches.

The output should display the difference between the `feature-1` and `feature-2` branches.This shows how the final result will look likeï¼š
