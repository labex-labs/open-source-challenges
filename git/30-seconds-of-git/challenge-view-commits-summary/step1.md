# View a Short Summary of Commits

## Problem

As a developer, you are working on a project with multiple contributors. You need to view a summary of all the commits made to the project to understand the changes that have been made and to identify any potential issues. However, you don't want to spend a lot of time sifting through all the commit messages to find the information you need.

## Example

View a short summary of all the commits made to a Git repository. For example, let's say you are working on a project hosted on GitHub called `git-playground`.

1. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and view a short summary of all the commits.

This will output a list of all the commits made to the repository, along with a short summary of each commit message. For example:

```shell
d22f46b (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/feature-branch, origin/HEAD) Added file2.txt
cf80005 Added file1.txt
b00b937 Initial commit
```
