# Push Local Changes to Remote

As a developer, you may need to push your local changes to a remote repository to share your work with other team members or to deploy your code to a production environment. The `git push` command is used to push the latest changes from the local branch to the remote. However, before pushing the changes, you need to ensure that your local branch is up to date with the remote branch. If there are any conflicts between the local and remote branches, you need to resolve them before pushing the changes.

To complete this lab, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`. You have made some changes to the `master` branch and want to push them to the remote repository. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the directory by running the following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-playground
cd git-playground
```
2. Ensure that your local branch is up to date with the remote branch by running the following command:
```shell
git pull origin master
```
3. Once you have pulled the latest changes from the remote branch, you can make your changes to the local branch:
```shell
echo "hello,world" >> file1.txt
```
4. After making the changes, stage them using the `git add` command:
```shell
git add .
```
5. Commit the changes using the `git commit` command:
```shell
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```
6. Finally, push the changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command:
```shell
git push origin master
```

This is the result of running `git log`:
```shell
commit 1f1949955387a1549f1bb5286d3d0a2b993f87e0 (HEAD -> master,origin/master,origin/HEAD)
