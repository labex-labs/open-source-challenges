# Clone a Repository

## Problem

As a developer, you often need to work on code that is stored in a remote repository. Cloning the repository allows you to create a local copy of the code that you can work on and modify without affecting the original codebase. This is useful for making changes, testing new features, and collaborating with others.

## Example

Clone the repository from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git` into a special directory called `my-project` in `/home/labex/project`.
