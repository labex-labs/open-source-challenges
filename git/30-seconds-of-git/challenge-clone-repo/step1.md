# Clone a Repository

As a developer, you often need to work on code that is stored in a remote repository. Cloning the repository allows you to create a local copy of the code that you can work on and modify without affecting the original codebase. This is useful for making changes, testing new features, and collaborating with others.

## Tasks

1. Clone the firt trending repository from [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending) to `~/project/` directory, and rename the directory to `first-trending-repo`.

## Example

When you finish the tasks, the `~/project/` directory should look like this:

```bash
ls -a ~/project/
```

```text
.  ..  first-trending-repo
```
