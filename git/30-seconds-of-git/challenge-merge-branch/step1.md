# Merge a Branch

## Problem

Your task is to merge a branch into the current branch using Git. You will need to switch to the target branch and then merge the source branch into it. This can be useful when you want to combine changes from a `feature-branch-A` branch into the `master` branch of your project.

## Example

For this challenge, let's use the repository from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Navigate to the repository directory and configure your GitHub identity .
2. Create and switch to `feature-branch-A`, add "hello" to `file2.txt`, add it to the staging area and commit it, the commit message will be "fix file2.txt".
3. Switch to the `master` branch and merge the `feature-branch-A` into the `master` branch.
4. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.

This is the final result:
```shell
commit 742e0d4feeec7c5989e2336de7526600301e284e (HEAD -> master, feature-branch-A)

    fix file2.txt
```
