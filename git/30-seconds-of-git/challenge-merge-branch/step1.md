# Merge a Branch

## Problem

Your task is to merge a branch into the current branch using Git. You will need to switch to the target branch and then merge the source branch into it. This can be useful when you want to combine changes from a `feature-branch-A` branch into the `master` branch of your project.

## Example

For this challenge, let's use the repository from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Navigate to the directory and configure the identity.
2. Create a `feature-branch-A` branch. Switch to it.
3. Add "hello,world" to the `file2.txt` file, add it to the staging area and commit it with the message "fix file2.txt".
4. Switch to the `master` branch.
5. Merge the `feature-branch-A` into the `master` branch.
6. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.

This is the result of running `git log`:
```shell
commit e2b80358ae6e4c3b8439cf111a4672a188739290 (HEAD -> master, feature-branch-A)

    fix file2.txt
```
