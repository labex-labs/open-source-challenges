# Merge a Branch

## Problem

Your task is to merge a branch into the current branch using Git. You will need to switch to the target branch and then merge the source branch into it. This can be useful when you want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch of your project.

## Example

To complete this experiment, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-playground`.
2. Switch to the `master` branch.
3. Merge the `feature-branch` into the `master` branch.
4. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.
5. Push the changes to the remote repository.

This is the result of running `git branch --merged master`:
