# Delete Merged Branches

## Problem

Your task is to delete all local branches that have been merged into the `master` branch of the `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` repository.

## Example

1. Change to the repository directory.
2. List all local branches that have been merged into `master`.
3. Delete all merged branches.
4. List all branches again.

This is the final result:
```
* master
```
