# Set Default Push Branch Name

## Problem

When pushing changes to a remote repository, Git will use the name of the current local branch as the default name for the remote branch. However, sometimes you may want to push your changes to a different branch. In this case, you would need to specify the name of the remote branch explicitly every time you push your changes. This can be tedious and error-prone, especially if you are working with multiple branches.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`. Follow the steps below to set the default push branch name:

1. Clone the repository from `https://github.com/your-username/git-playground.git`.
2. Change to the repository directory.
3. Set the default push branch name to the name of the current local branch.
4. Create a new branch named `my-branch` and switch to it.
5. Create a new file called `hello.txt` and write the string "Hello, World" into it. Add the newly created file `hello.txt` to the Git staging area and commit it, using the commit message "Add hello.txt" to describe the changes made in this commit.
6. Push your changes to the remote repository. Git will push your changes to a branch named `my-branch` on the remote repository.

This is the result of running `git log`:
```shell
commit 1f1949959887a1549f1bb5286d3d0a2b993f87e0 (HEAD -> my-branch, origin/my-branch)
