# Find Lost Files

## Problem

You have been working on a project in the `git-playground` repository. However, you have noticed that some files are missing and you are not sure when they were deleted or how to recover them. Your task is to use Git to find any lost files and commits in the repository.

## Example

1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Run a command to find any lost files and commits.
3. Check the `.git/lost-found` directory to see if any lost files were recovered.
4. If any lost files were found, review them to determine if they are the missing files.
