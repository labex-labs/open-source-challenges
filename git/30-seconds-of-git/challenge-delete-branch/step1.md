# Delete a Branch

## Problem

You have created a local branch in your Git repository, and you no longer need it. You want to delete the branch to keep your repository clean and organized.

## Example

1. Navigate to the cloned repository.
2. View current branches.
3. Delete the `feature-1` branch.
4. Verify that the branch has been deleted.

This is the result of running the `git branch` command:
```
* master
```
