# View a Visual Graph of the Repository

## Problem

As a developer, you may need to view the history of a repository to understand how the code has changed over time. However, simply viewing a list of commits can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This is where the Git graph comes in. By visualizing the history of a repository, you can quickly see how the code has evolved and identify any issues or bugs that may have been introduced.

## Example

To view a visual graph of a Git repository, let's say you want to view the history of the `git-playground` repository on GitHub. 

1. Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the directory and view the graph.
2. Display a visual graph of all the commits and branches in the repository, allowing you to see how the code has evolved over time.

This is the final result:
```
