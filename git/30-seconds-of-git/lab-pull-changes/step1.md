# Pull Latest Changes from Remote

You are working on a project with a team of developers, and you need to ensure that your local copy of the codebase is up to date with the latest changes made by your team members. To do this, you need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

For this lab, we will be using the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Follow the steps below to complete the lab:

1. Change into the directory of the cloned repository:
```shell
cd git-playground
```
2. Pull the latest changes from the `master` branch of the remote repository:
```shell
git pull origin master
```

After running the `git pull` command, you should see a message indicating that your local copy of the repository is up to date with the remote repository.

This is the result after pulling:
