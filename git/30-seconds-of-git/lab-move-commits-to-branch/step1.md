# Move Commits to a New Branch

For this lab, let's use the repository from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. You have been working on a project in the `master` branch. You realize that some of the changes you made should have been made on a separate branch. You want to move these changes to a new branch called `feature`.

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the directory and configure the identity:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground
cd git-playground
git config --global user.name "your-username"
git config --global user.email "your-email"
```
2. Checkout the `master` branch:
``` shell
git checkout master
```
3. Create a file called `hello.txt`, add "hello, world" to it, add it to the staging area and submit it with the message "Added hello.txt":
```shell
echo "hello,world" >> hello.txt
git add . 
git commit -m "Added hello.txt"
```
4. Create a new branch called `feature` without switching to it. When you create a new branch on the `master` branch, the state of the new branch is the same as the `master` branch, i.e., the files in the new branch are the same as the files in the `master` branch, with the same content and version history:
```shell
git branch feature
```
5. Undo the last commit on `master`:
``` shell
git reset HEAD~1 --hard
```
6. Check the commit history on the `master` branch and the commit history on the `feature` branch to verify the results:
```shell
git log
git checkout feature
git log
```

This is the result of running `git log`:
```shell
commit 7969ab5d6606e2a40c9fd826c732206b835976e9 (HEAD -> feature)
