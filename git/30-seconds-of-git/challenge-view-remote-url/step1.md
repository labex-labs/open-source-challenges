# View the Remote URL

## Problem

As a developer, you may need to view the URL of a remote repository for various reasons, such as troubleshooting issues with your Git configuration or verifying that you are working with the correct repository. However, if you are not familiar with Git commands, it can be challenging to know how to view the remote URL.

## Example

For this challenge, we will be using the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. View the remote URL of this repository.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned the `git-playground` repository.
3. View the remote URL.

The output should display the URL of the remote repository, which in this case is `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.
