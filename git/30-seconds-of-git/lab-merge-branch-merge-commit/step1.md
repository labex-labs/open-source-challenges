# Merge a Branch and Create a Merge Commit

As a developer, you may need to merge a branch into the current branch, creating a merge commit. This can be a bit tricky if you're not familiar with Git. The problem is to merge a branch into the current branch, creating a merge commit, using the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` directory.

For this challenge, let's use the repository from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Clone a repository from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory and configure the identity: 
```shell
cd git-playground
git config --global user.name "your-username"
git config --global user.email "your-email"
```
3. Create and switch to a branch called `feature-branch`:
```shell
git checkout -b feature-branch
```
4. Add "This is a new line." to the `README.md` file, add it to the staging area and commit it, the commit message is "Add new line to README.md":
```shell
echo "This is a new line." >> README.md
git add .
git commit -am "Add new line to README.md"
```
5. Switch to the `master` branch:
```shell
git checkout master
```
6. Merge the `feature-branch` into the `master` branch,which will create a merge commit with the message "Merge feature-branch":
```shell
git merge --no-ff -m "Merge feature-branch" feature-branch
```

This is the result of running `git log`:
```shell
commit 45b7e0fa8656d0aa751c7ca3cee29422e3d6cf05 (HEAD -> master)
