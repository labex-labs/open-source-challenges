# Switch to a Branch

## Problem

You have been working on a project in a Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Your team has created a new branch named `feature-1` to work on a new feature. You need to switch to the `feature-1` branch to continue working on the feature.

## Example

1. List all the branches in the repository.
2. Switch to the `feature-1` branch.
3. Verify that you are now on the `feature-1` branch.

This is the final result:
```shell
* feature-1
  master
```
