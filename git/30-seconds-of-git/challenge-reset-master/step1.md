# Reset Local Master Branch to Match Remote

## Problem

You have been working on a project and have made changes to the local `master` branch. However, you realize that the remote `master` branch has been updated with new changes that you do not have in your local branch. You need to reset the local `master` branch to match the one on the remote.

## Example

1. Clone the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` directory.
2. Retrieve the latest updates from the remote.
3. Switch to the `master` branch.
4. Update the contents of file1.txt to "hello" and add it to the staging area.
5. View current status.
6. Reset the local `master` branch to match the one on the remote.
7. Verify that the local `master` branch is now up to date with the remote `master` branch.
