# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to commit changes without running Git hooks by using the `--no-verify` option. While this can be useful in some situations, it is generally better to fix any issues detected by the hooks before committing your changes. This helps ensure that your code is of high quality and meets the standards of your team or organization.
