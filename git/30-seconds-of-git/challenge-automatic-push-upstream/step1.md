# Automate Upstream Branch Creation

## Problem

As a developer, you want to automate the process of creating upstream branches on push to avoid the hassle of manually creating the branch on the remote repository.

## Example

For this challenge, you will fork the https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground repository to your account, using the `git-playground` repository on your account to automatically create the upstream branch on push.

1. On the GitHub website, log in to your account and find https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground to fork the repository to your account.
2. On the page for your own forked repository, click the `Code` button and copy the URL of the repository.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the repository directory.
5. Use a command to enable automatic upstream branch creation on push.
6. Push your changes to a new branch called `new-feature`, which does not exist in the remote repository.
7. Verify that the new branch has been created on the remote repository.

This is the result after completing the challenge:
