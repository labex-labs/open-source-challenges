# Automate Upstream Branch Creation

## Problem

As a developer, you want to automate the process of creating upstream branches on push to avoid the hassle of manually creating the branch on the remote repository.

## Example

In this challenge, you will use the git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` directory to enable automatic upstream branch creation on push.

1. On the GitHub website, log in to your account and find the page for the repository you want to fork.

2. Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner of the repository page to fork the repository into your own account.

3. On the page for your own forked repository, click the `Code` button and copy the URL of the repository.

4. Clone the repository to your local machine.

5. Navigate to the repository directory.

6. Use a command to enable automatic upstream branch creation on push.

7. Push your changes to a new branch called `new-feature`, which does not exist in the remote repository.

This is the result after completing the challenge:
