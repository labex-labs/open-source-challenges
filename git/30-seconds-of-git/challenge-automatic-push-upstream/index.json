  "title": "Automate Upstream Branch Creation",
  "description": "In a collaborative project, it is common to have multiple developers working on different branches of the same repository. When a developer pushes their changes to a branch that does not exist on the remote repository, the push will fail. This is where upstream branch creation comes in handy. By enabling automatic upstream branch creation on push, developers can avoid the hassle of manually creating the branch on the remote repository.",
