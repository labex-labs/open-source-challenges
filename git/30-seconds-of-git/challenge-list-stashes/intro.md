# List All Stashes

In Git, stashing is a way to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed. Stashing allows you to switch branches or work on a different task without losing your current progress. Once you are ready to continue working on the changes, you can apply the stash and continue where you left off. In this challenge, you will learn how to list all stashes in a Git repository.
