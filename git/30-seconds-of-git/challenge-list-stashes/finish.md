# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to list all stashes in a Git repository using the `git stash list` command. This command displays a list of all stashes, including the stash reference, the branch where the stash was created, and the stash message. By listing all stashes, you can decide which one to apply and continue working on your changes.
