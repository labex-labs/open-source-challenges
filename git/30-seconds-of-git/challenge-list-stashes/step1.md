# List All Stashes

## Problem

You are working on a project in a Git repository and have made some changes that are not yet ready to be committed. You decide to stash these changes so that you can work on a different task. Later, you want to see a list of all the stashes you have created so that you can decide which one to apply. How do you list all stashes in a Git repository?

## Example

1. Navigate to the `git-playground` directory.
2. List all stashes.

You should see output similar to the following:
```
stash@{0}: On master: Added test2.txt
stash@{1}: On master: Added test.txt
```
