  "description": "In Git, a branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Branches are used to develop features, isolate changes, and experiment without affecting other parts of the repository. Remote branches are references to the state of branches on remote repositories. They are used to keep track of the progress of other developers' work and to collaborate on projects.",
