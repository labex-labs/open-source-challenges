# Rename Remote Branch

## Problem

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`. You have a Git repository named `https://github.com/your-username/git-playground`. You have created a branch named `feature-1` and pushed it to the remote. Now you want to rename the branch to `new-feature-1` both locally and on the remote.

## Example

1. Open the terminal and clone the Git repository.
2. Change to the repository directory.
3. Create a new branch named `feature-1` and switch to it.
4. Push the branch to the remote.
5. Rename the branch both locally and on the remote.
6. Verify that the branch has been renamed.

This is the result of running `git branch -a`:
