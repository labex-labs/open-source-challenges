# Rename Remote Branch

## Problem

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`. Please uncheck "Copy master branch only" when forking. 

You have a Git repository named `https://github.com/your-username/git-playground`. You have created a branch named `feature-branch` and pushed it to the remote. Now you want to rename the branch to `new-feature-1` both locally and on the remote.

## Example

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the directory and configure the identity.
2. Switch to the named `feature-branch` branch.
3. Rename the branch both locally and on the remote.
4. Verify that the branch has been renamed.

This is the result of running `git branch -a`:
```shell
* master
  new-feature-1
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/new-feature-1
```
