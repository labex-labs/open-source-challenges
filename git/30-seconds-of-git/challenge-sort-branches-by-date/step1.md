# Sort Git Branches by Date

## Problem

You have a Git repository with multiple branches, and you want to sort them by date. This will allow you to see which branches have been updated recently and which ones have not. Sorting branches by date can also help you identify branches that may need attention or merging.

## Example

For this challenge, we will be using the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the directory.

2. Now, sort the branches by date.

This will display a list of all local branches and sort them based on the date of their last commit. You can use the arrow keys to navigate the list, and press <kbd>Q</kbd> to exit.

This is the finished result:

```shell
* master
  one-branch
  three-branch
  two-branch
```
