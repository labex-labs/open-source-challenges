# Switch to a Branch

You have been working on a project in a Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. Your team has created a new branch named `feature-1` to work on a new feature. You need to switch to the `feature-1` branch to continue working on the feature.

1. Clone the Git repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```shell
cd git-playground
```
3. List all the branches in the repository:
```shell
git branch
```
Output:
```shell
  feature-1
* master
```
4. Switch to the `feature-1` branch:
```shell
git checkout feature-1
```
Output:
```shell
Switched to branch 'feature-1'
```
5. Verify that you are now on the `feature-1` branch:
```shell
git branch
```
Output:
```shell
* feature-1
  master
```
