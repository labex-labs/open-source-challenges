# Delete All Stashes

## Problem

You have been working on a project in a Git repository and have created multiple stashes to save your changes. Now, you want to delete all stashes to start fresh. However, you are not sure how to do it.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. See the current stash.
3. Delete all stashes at once.
4. Verify that all stashes have been deleted.

The stashes you just deleted should no longer be there.
