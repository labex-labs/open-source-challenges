  "description": "Git is a popular version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase. One of the useful features of Git is the ability to create branches, which are essentially separate copies of the codebase that can be modified independently. However, sometimes it can be difficult to keep track of which branches contain certain commits. In this challenge, you will learn how to find branches that do not contain a specific commit.",
