# Return to Previous Branch

## Problem

As a developer, you are working on a project and have switched to a different branch to work on a new feature. After making some changes, you realize that you need to switch back to the previous branch to fix a bug. You can commit your changes in a new branch and use a command to quickly switch to the previous branch.

## Example

To demonstrate how to switch back to the previous branch, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.

1. See the status of the current branch.
2. Check the current branch and switch to the previous branch quickly. The name of your new branch is `feature-branch` and the name of the previous branch you want to switch back to is `master`.
