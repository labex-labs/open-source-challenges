# Discard Untracked Changes

## Problem

You are working on a project using Git and have made some changes to your working directory. However, you realize that you don't need these changes and want to discard them. You want to discard all untracked changes to the current branch.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`.

1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Check the status of your working directory.
3. Discard all untracked changes to the current branch.
4. Check the status of your working directory again.

You should see the following output:
```shell
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
