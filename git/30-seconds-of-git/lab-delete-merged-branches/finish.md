# Summary

Deleting merged branches is a good practice to keep your local repository clean and organized. Use the `git branch --merged <branch>` command to list all branches merged into `<branch>`, and the `git branch -d <branch>` command to delete a branch. Remember to always be careful when deleting branches, as you may lose important work if you delete the wrong branch.
