# Git Challenge: Rewind Commits

## Problem

As a developer, you have been working on a project and have made several commits. However, you realize that the last few commits contain errors and you need to go back to a previous version of your code. You need to use Git to rewind your commits and get back to the previous version of your code.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from your GitHub account, which comes from a fork of `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch called `rewind-commits`.
3. Create a new file called `hello.py` with the text "Hello, World" and add it to the Git staging area. Then commit the changes with the message "Add hello.py file".
4. Update the contents of the file `hello.py` to "Hello, Git" and add the changes to the Git staging area. Then use the "Update hello.py file" message to commit the changes.
5. Realize that the last few commits contain errors and you need to go back to the previous version of your code.
6. Use Git to rewind your commits by 1.
7. Verify that you have successfully rewound your commits by checking the code in your working directory.
8. Push your changes to the `rewind-commits` branch.

This is the final result:
