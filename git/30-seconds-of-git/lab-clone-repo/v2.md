# Clone a Git Repository

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to clone a Git repository and explore some advanced cloning options. Git is a powerful version control system widely used in software development. Cloning a repository is a fundamental skill that allows you to create a local copy of a remote repository, enabling you to work on the code, make changes, and collaborate with others. This lab is designed for beginners and will guide you through the process step-by-step, focusing on practical applications of repository cloning.

## Steps

### Step 1: Clone a Basic Repository

Let's start by cloning a simple repository. We'll use the `git-playground` repository from GitHub as an example.

First, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ~/project
```

Now, let's clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git
```

This command creates a new directory named `git-playground` in your current directory and downloads all the repository files into it.

When you clone a repository, you're creating a local version of all the files, branches, and commits that exist in the remote repository. It's like making a complete copy of a project's codebase and its entire history.

After the cloning process is complete, you should see output similar to this:

Let's break down what's happening:

1. Git creates a new directory with the same name as the repository (`git-playground`).
2. It initializes a new Git repository in this directory.
3. It sets up a remote called "origin" that points to the URL you cloned from.
4. It pulls down all the data for that repository.
5. It checks out a working copy of the latest version of the main branch (usually called "master" or "main").

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify repository cloning
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project
    [[ -d git-playground && -d git-playground/.git ]]
  hint: |
    The git-playground directory was not found or is not a Git repository. 
    Make sure you've successfully cloned the repository.

- name: Check if repository is on the expected branch
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project/git-playground
    git status | grep -q "On branch"
  hint: |
    The cloned repository is not on the expected branch. 
    This might indicate an issue with the cloning process.
```

### Step 2: Explore the Cloned Repository

Now that we've cloned the repository, let's explore its contents. Navigate into the new directory:

```bash
cd git-playground
```

List the contents of the directory:

```bash
ls -la
```

This command shows all files and directories, including hidden ones. You should see a `.git` directory, which contains all the Git-related information for this repository.

Here's what you might see:

- Regular files and directories: These are the actual project files you can work with.
- `.git` directory: This hidden directory is where Git stores all its tracking information.
- `.gitignore` file (if present): This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in the project.

To see the commit history of the repository, use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This shows a condensed version of the commit history. Each line represents a commit, with its unique identifier (hash) and commit message.

Understanding the structure of a cloned repository is crucial for effective version control. The `.git` directory contains all the information that Git uses to manage versions, while the other files and directories represent the current state of the project.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify navigation to git-playground
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project/git-playground
    [[ $(pwd) == "/home/labex/project/git-playground" ]]
  hint: |
    You are not in the git-playground directory. 
    Make sure you've navigated into the cloned repository.

- name: Check for .git directory
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project/git-playground
    [[ -d .git ]]
  hint: |
    The .git directory was not found in the git-playground repository. 
    This might indicate an issue with the cloning process.

- name: Verify git log command works
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project/git-playground
    git log --oneline | grep -q "commit"
  hint: |
    Unable to retrieve git log. Make sure the repository has been cloned correctly and has a commit history.
```

### Step 3: Clone to a Specific Directory

Sometimes, you might want to clone a repository into a directory with a different name. This is useful when working on multiple versions of a project or when you want to give the directory a more descriptive name.

Let's clone the same repository again, but this time into a directory named `my-project`:

```bash
cd ~/project
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git my-project
```

This command does two things:

1. It clones the `git-playground` repository
2. It puts the cloned files into a new directory called `my-project` instead of `git-playground`

After the cloning process is complete, you should see output similar to this:

![<result>](./assets/challenge-clone-repo-step1-2.png)

This feature is particularly useful when:

- You already have a directory with the same name as the repository
- You want to clone the same repository multiple times for different purposes
- You want to give the directory a name that's more meaningful in the context of your local project structure

Remember, the name of the directory doesn't affect the Git repository itself - it's just the name of the folder on your local machine.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify cloning to specific directory
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project
    [[ -d my-project && -d my-project/.git ]]
  hint: |
    The my-project directory was not found or is not a Git repository. 
    Make sure you've successfully cloned the repository to the specified directory.

- name: Check if repository in my-project is on expected branch
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project/my-project
    git status | grep -q "On branch"
  hint: |
    The cloned repository in my-project is not on the expected branch. 
    This might indicate an issue with the cloning process.

- name: Verify my-project is a different directory from git-playground
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project
    [[ -d git-playground && -d my-project && ! -L my-project ]]
  hint: |
    Both git-playground and my-project should exist as separate directories. 
    Make sure you've cloned the repository twice with different directory names.
```

### Step 4: Shallow Clone with Depth

Sometimes, you might only need the most recent version of a repository without its full history. In such cases, you can perform a shallow clone using the `--depth` option.

Let's clone the repository again, but this time only fetch the most recent commit:

```bash
cd ~/project
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git shallow-repo
```

This command creates a shallow clone with a history truncated to only the last commit. The `--depth 1` option tells Git to only fetch the most recent commit.

Shallow clones can be significantly faster and take up less disk space, which is particularly useful for large repositories when you don't need the full history.

To verify the shallow clone, navigate into the new directory and check the git log:

```bash
cd shallow-repo
git log --oneline
```

You should only see one commit in the log.

If you later decide you need more history, you can fetch it using:

```bash
git fetch --unshallow
```

This will retrieve the full history of the repository.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify shallow clone
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project
    [[ -d shallow-repo && -d shallow-repo/.git ]]
  hint: |
    The shallow-repo directory was not found or is not a Git repository. 
    Make sure you've successfully created a shallow clone.

- name: Check if shallow clone has only one commit
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project/shallow-repo
    [[ $(git rev-list --count HEAD) -eq 1 ]]
  hint: |
    The shallow clone should have only one commit. 
    Make sure you used the --depth 1 option when cloning.
```

### Step 5: Clone a Specific Branch

Sometimes, you might want to clone only a specific branch of a repository. This can be useful when you're only interested in a particular feature or version of the project.

Let's clone a specific branch of the repository:

```bash
cd ~/project
git clone -b main https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git branch-repo
```

The `-b main` option tells Git to clone only the `main` branch. Replace `main` with the name of the branch you want to clone if it's different.

After cloning, navigate into the new directory and check which branch you're on:

```bash
cd branch-repo
git branch
```

You should see only the `main` branch (or whichever branch you specified).

This approach can save time and disk space when working with large repositories where you only need a specific branch.

#### Verification

```yaml
- name: Verify branch-specific clone
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project
    [[ -d branch-repo && -d branch-repo/.git ]]
  hint: |
    The branch-repo directory was not found or is not a Git repository. 
    Make sure you've successfully cloned the specific branch.

- name: Check if only the specified branch exists
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /home/labex/project/branch-repo
    [[ $(git branch | wc -l) -eq 1 && $(git branch | grep -c "main") -eq 1 ]]
  hint: |
    The cloned repository should only have the main branch. 
    Make sure you used the -b option when cloning.
```
