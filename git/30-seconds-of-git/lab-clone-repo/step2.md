# Explore the Cloned Repository

Now that we've cloned the repository, let's explore its contents. Navigate into the new directory:

```bash
cd git-playground
```

List the contents of the directory:

```bash
ls -la
```

This command shows all files and directories, including hidden ones. You should see a `.git` directory, which contains all the Git-related information for this repository.

Here's what you might see:

- Regular files and directories: These are the actual project files you can work with.
- `.git` directory: This hidden directory is where Git stores all its tracking information.
- `.gitignore` file (if present): This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in the project.

To see the commit history of the repository, use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This shows a condensed version of the commit history. Each line represents a commit, with its unique identifier (hash) and commit message.

Understanding the structure of a cloned repository is crucial for effective version control. The `.git` directory contains all the information that Git uses to manage versions, while the other files and directories represent the current state of the project.
