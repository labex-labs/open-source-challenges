# View Changes Between Commits

Git is a popular version control system that allows developers to track changes made to their codebase over time. One of the most useful features of Git is the ability to view changes between two commits. This can be helpful when trying to understand what changes were made to a codebase, or when trying to identify the cause of a bug.
