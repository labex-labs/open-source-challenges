In Git, a remote is a version of your repository that is hosted on a server or another computer. When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin` that points to the original repository. However, sometimes you may need to change the URL of the remote repository. This challenge will test your ability to change the remote URL using Git commands.
