# Autocorrect Git Commands

## Problem

The problem is that developers often mistype git commands, which can lead to errors and slow down their workflow. For example, a developer might accidentally type `git sttaus` instead of `git status`, which will result in an error message. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially when working on large projects with many files and collaborators.

## Example

To demonstrate how to use Git's autocorrect feature, we will use the git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground` directory.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

2. Clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git
```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository using the following command:

```
cd git-playground
```

4. Enable Git's autocorrect feature using the following command.

5. Try mistyping a git command, such as `git inii`. Git will automatically correct the command and run `git init` instead.
