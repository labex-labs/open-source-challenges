# Manually Find the Commit that Introduced a Bug

Your task is to manually find the commit that introduced a bug in the `git-playground` repository. The repository can be found at `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. The bug is that the `file2.txt` file should print "This is file2.txt." instead of "This is file2.".

To complete this lab, you will need to use the `git bisect` command to perform a binary search through the commit history of the repository. You will need to mark commits as either "good" (bug-free) or "bad" (buggy) until you have narrowed down the commit that introduced the bug.

1. Change into the repository directory:
```
cd git-playground
```
2. Start the `git bisect` process:
```
git bisect start
```
3. Mark the current commit as "bad":
```
git bisect bad HEAD
```
4. Mark a commit with the message "Initial commit" as "good". Git will automatically checkout a new commit for you to test:
```
git bisect good 3050fc0de
```
Git will automatically checkout a new commit for you to test.
5. If the contents of the checked `file2.txt` file do not match the bug, mark it as "good":
```
cat file2.txt
git bisect good
```
6. If the contents of the checked `file2.txt` file  match the bug, mark it as "bad":
```
git bisect bad
```
7. Once you have found the buggy commit, reset the `git bisect` process:
```
git bisect reset
```
You can now examine the code changes in the buggy commit to find the source of the bug.

This is the result of the test:
```
