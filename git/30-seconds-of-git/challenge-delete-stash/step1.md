# Delete a Git Stash

## Problem

You have a Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. You have created a stash. Now, you want to delete this stash because you no longer need it.

## Example

1. List all stashes. You should see the current stash.
2. Delete the stash.
3. List all stashes again. The stash you just deleted should no longer be there.
