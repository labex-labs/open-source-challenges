# Delete a Git Stash

You have a Git repository named `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground`. You have created a stash using the command `git stash save "my stash"`. Now, you want to delete this stash because you no longer need it.

## Tasks

1. Change to the repository directory.
2. List all stashes. You should see the current stash.
3. Delete the stash.
4. List all stashes again.

The stash you just deleted should no longer be there.
