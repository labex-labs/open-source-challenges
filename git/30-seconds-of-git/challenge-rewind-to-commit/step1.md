# Rewind to a Specific Commit

## Problem

As a developer, you may need to undo changes made to your codebase. For example, you may have made a mistake and need to go back to an earlier version of your code. In this challenge, you will use Git to rewind back to a specific commit in a repository.

## Example

To complete this challenge, you will use the Git repository `git-playground` from `https://github.com/labex-labs/git-playground.git`.

1. View the commit history of the repository.
2. Make sure that the commit message you want to rewind to is the "Initial commit" commit hash.
3. Rewind back to the commit hash.
4. View the commit history of the repository again.

This is the result of running `git log --oneline`:
```shell
c0d30f305 (HEAD -> master) Initial commit
```
