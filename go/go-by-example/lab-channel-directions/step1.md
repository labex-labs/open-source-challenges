# Golang Challenge: Channel Directions

## Problem

The problem to be solved in this challenge is to modify the given code to ensure that the channels used as function parameters are specified to only send or receive values.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Golang
- Understanding of channels and their usage in Golang

## Example

```sh
$ go run channel-directions.go
passed message
```

## Solution

```go
// When using channels as function parameters, you can
// specify if a channel is meant to only send or receive
// values. This specificity increases the type-safety of
// the program.

package main

import "fmt"

// This `ping` function only accepts a channel for sending
// values. It would be a compile-time error to try to
// receive on this channel.
func ping(pings chan<- string, msg string) {
	pings <- msg
}

// The `pong` function accepts one channel for receives
// (`pings`) and a second for sends (`pongs`).
func pong(pings <-chan string, pongs chan<- string) {
	msg := <-pings
	pongs <- msg
}

func main() {
	pings := make(chan string, 1)
	pongs := make(chan string, 1)
	ping(pings, "passed message")
	pong(pings, pongs)
	fmt.Println(<-pongs)
}

```
