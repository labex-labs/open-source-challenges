# Functions

## Problem

In the given code, we have two functions `plus` and `plusPlus`. The `plus` function takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The `plusPlus` function takes three integers as arguments and returns their sum. Your task is to complete the `plusPlus` function by adding the third integer to the sum of the first two integers.

## Requirements

- The `plus` function should take two integers as arguments and return their sum as an integer.
- The `plusPlus` function should take three integers as arguments and return their sum as an integer.
- The `plusPlus` function should use the `plus` function to calculate the sum of the first two integers.

## Example

```sh
$ go run functions.go 
1+2 = 3
1+2+3 = 6

# There are several other features to Go functions. One is
# multiple return values, which we'll look at next.
