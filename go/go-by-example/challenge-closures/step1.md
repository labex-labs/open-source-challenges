# Closures

You need to create a function that returns another function. The returned function should increment a variable by one each time it is called. The variable should be unique to each returned function.

## Requirements

- The function `intSeq` should return another function.
- The returned function should increment a variable by one each time it is called.
- The variable should be unique to each returned function.

## Example

```sh
$ go run closures.go
1
2
3
1

# The last feature of functions we'll look at for now is
# recursion.
```
