# Slices

## Introduction

The Slices lab is designed to test your knowledge of the slice data type in Go. Slices are a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays, and this lab will help you understand how to use them.

The problem to be solved in this lab is to create and manipulate slices in Go. You will need to create an empty slice with non-zero length, set and get values in the slice, use the `len` function to get the length of the slice, use the `append` function to add new values to the slice, use the `copy` function to copy a slice, and use the slice operator to get a slice of elements from an existing slice.

To complete this lab, you will need to have a basic understanding of Go syntax and the slice data type. You will also need to be familiar with the `make`, `append`, and `copy` functions, as well as the slice operator.

## TODO

Use the TODO keyword to mark the code that needs to be completed.

```
// Create an empty slice with non-zero length
s := make([]int, TODO)

// Set values in the slice
s[0] = TODO
s[1] = TODO
s[2] = TODO

// Get values from the slice
fmt.Println("s[0]:", TODO)
fmt.Println("s[1]:", TODO)
fmt.Println("s[2]:", TODO)

// Get the length of the slice
fmt.Println("len(s):", TODO)

// Append new values to the slice
s = append(s, TODO)
s = append(s, TODO, TODO)
fmt.Println("s:", TODO)

// Copy the slice
c := make([]int, TODO)
copy(c, s)
fmt.Println("c:", TODO)

// Get a slice of elements from an existing slice
l := s[TODO:TODO]
fmt.Println("l:", TODO)
```

```
emp: [  ]
set: [a b c]
get: c
len: 3
apd: [a b c d e f]
cpy: [a b c d e f]
sl1: [c d e]
sl2: [a b c d e]
sl3: [c d e f]
dcl: [g h i]
2d:  [[0] [1 2] [2 3 4]]
```

## Summary

The Slices lab is designed to test your knowledge of the slice data type in Go. By completing this lab, you will gain a better understanding of how to create and manipulate slices in Go, including how to set and get values in a slice, use the `len` function, use the `append` and `copy` functions, and use the slice operator.
