# if-else

## Problem

You are required to complete the `checkNumber` function that takes an integer as input and returns a string. If the number is even, return "even", otherwise return "odd".

## Requirements

- The function should be named `checkNumber`.
- The function should take an integer as input.
- The function should return a string.
- If the number is even, return "even".
- If the number is odd, return "odd".

## Example

```sh
$ go run if-else.go
7 is odd
8 is divisible by 4
9 has 1 digit

# There is no [ternary if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:)
# in Go, so you'll need to use a full `if` statement even
# for basic conditions.
```
