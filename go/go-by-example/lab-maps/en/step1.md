# Maps

In this lab, you will need to create a map that stores the number of times each word appears in a given string. You will need to split the string into words, and then iterate over each word, adding it to the map if it doesn't already exist, or incrementing its count if it does.

- You must use a map to store the word counts.
- You must split the input string into words.
- You must iterate over each word in the input string.
- You must add each word to the map if it doesn't already exist, or increment its count if it does.

```sh
# Note that maps appear in the form `map[k:v k:v]` when
# printed with `fmt.Println`.
$ go run maps.go
map: map[k1:7 k2:13]
v1: 7
v3: 0
len: 2
map: map[k1:7]
prs: false
map: map[bar:2 foo:1]
```

There is the full code below:

```go
// _Maps_ are Go's built-in [associative data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)
// (sometimes called _hashes_ or _dicts_ in other languages).

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	// To create an empty map, use the builtin `make`:
	// `make(map[key-type]val-type)`.
	m := make(map[string]int)

	// Set key/value pairs using typical `name[key] = val`
	// syntax.
	m["k1"] = 7
	m["k2"] = 13

	// Printing a map with e.g. `fmt.Println` will show all of
	// its key/value pairs.
	fmt.Println("map:", m)

	// Get a value for a key with `name[key]`.
	v1 := m["k1"]
	fmt.Println("v1:", v1)

	// If the key doesn't exist, the
	// [zero value](https://go.dev/ref/spec#The_zero_value) of the
	// value type is returned.
	v3 := m["k3"]
	fmt.Println("v3:", v3)

	// The builtin `len` returns the number of key/value
	// pairs when called on a map.
	fmt.Println("len:", len(m))

	// The builtin `delete` removes key/value pairs from
	// a map.
	delete(m, "k2")
	fmt.Println("map:", m)

	// The optional second return value when getting a
	// value from a map indicates if the key was present
	// in the map. This can be used to disambiguate
	// between missing keys and keys with zero values
	// like `0` or `""`. Here we didn't need the value
	// itself, so we ignored it with the _blank identifier_
	// `_`.
	_, prs := m["k2"]
	fmt.Println("prs:", prs)

	// You can also declare and initialize a new map in
	// the same line with this syntax.
	n := map[string]int{"foo": 1, "bar": 2}
	fmt.Println("map:", n)
}

```
