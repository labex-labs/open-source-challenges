// `for` is Go's only looping construct. Here are

func main() {
    // TODO
	// The most basic type, with a single condition.
	// A classic initial/condition/after `for` loop.
	// `for` without a condition will loop repeatedly
	// until you `break` out of the loop or `return` from
	// the enclosing function.
	// You can also `continue` to the next iteration of
	// the loop.
