# Arrays

## Problem

You are required to create an array of integers with a length of 5. You will then set a value at a specific index and retrieve a value from a specific index. You will also be required to find the length of the array and declare and initialize an array in one line. Finally, you will create a two-dimensional array and initialize it with values.

## Requirements

- Create an array of integers with a length of 5
- Set a value at a specific index and retrieve a value from a specific index
- Find the length of the array
- Declare and initialize an array in one line
- Create a two-dimensional array and initialize it with values

## Example

```sh
# Note that arrays appear in the form `[v1 v2 v3 ...]`
# when printed with `fmt.Println`.
$ go run arrays.go
emp: [0 0 0 0 0]
set: [0 0 0 0 100]
get: 100
len: 5
dcl: [1 2 3 4 5]
2d: [[0 1 2] [1 2 3]]
```
