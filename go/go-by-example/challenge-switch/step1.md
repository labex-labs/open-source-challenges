# Switch

## Problem

In this challenge, you need to complete the `switch` statement to print out the corresponding message based on the input value.

## Requirements

- The `switch` statement must be used to solve the problem.
- The `default` case must be used to handle unexpected input values.

## Example

```sh
$ go run switch.go 
Write 2 as two
It's a weekday
It's after noon
I'm a bool
I'm an int
Don't know type string

```
