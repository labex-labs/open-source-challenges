# Pointers

## Introduction

This lab will test your understanding of pointers in Golang. Pointers are used to pass references to values and records within your program.

The problem is to understand how pointers work in contrast to values with two functions: `zeroval` and `zeroptr`. `zeroval` has an `int` parameter, so arguments will be passed to it by value. `zeroval` will get a copy of `ival` distinct from the one in the calling function. `zeroptr` in contrast has an `*int` parameter, meaning that it takes an `int` pointer. The `*iptr` code in the function body then _dereferences_ the pointer from its memory address to the current value at that address. Assigning a value to a dereferenced pointer changes the value at the referenced address.

- You should have a basic understanding of Golang.
- You should know how to define and use functions in Golang.
- You should know how to use pointers in Golang.

## TODO

Complete the `zeroval` and `zeroptr` functions. Use the TODO keyword to mark the code that needs to be completed.

```go
func zeroval(ival int) {
    // TODO: Set ival to 0
}

func zeroptr(iptr *int) {
    // TODO: Set the value of iptr to 0
}
```

```
initial: 1
zeroval: 1
zeroptr: 0
pointer: 0x40e020
```

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use pointers in Golang. You also learned the difference between passing values and pointers to functions.
