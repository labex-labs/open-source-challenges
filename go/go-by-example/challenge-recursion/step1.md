# Recursion

## Problem

The `sum` function takes an integer slice and returns the sum of all the integers in the slice. However, the function is incomplete and needs to be implemented using recursion.

## Requirements

- The `sum` function must be implemented using recursion.
- The function must take an integer slice as input.
- The function must return the sum of all the integers in the slice.

## Example

```sh
$ go run recursion.go 
5040
13

```
