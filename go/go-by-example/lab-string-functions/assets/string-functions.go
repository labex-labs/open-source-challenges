// The standard library's `strings` package provides many
// useful string-related functions. Here are some examples
// to give you a sense of the package.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	s "strings"
)

// We alias `fmt.Println` to a shorter name as we'll use
// it a lot below.
var p = fmt.Println

func main() {
    // TODO
	// Here's a sample of the functions available in
	// `strings`. Since these are functions from the
	// package, not methods on the string object itself,
	// we need pass the string in question as the first
	// argument to the function. You can find more
	// functions in the [`strings`](https://pkg.go.dev/strings)
	// package docs.
