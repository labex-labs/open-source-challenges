# Constants

## Problem

The problem to be solved is to demonstrate the use of constants in Golang for character, string, boolean, and numeric values.

## Requirements

The Challenge has the following requirements:

- Use the `const` keyword to declare a constant value.
- Constants should be of character, string, boolean, and numeric values.
- A constant statement can appear anywhere a `var` statement can.
- Demonstrate that constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision.
- A numeric constant has no type until it's given one, such as by an explicit conversion.
- A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or function call.

## Example

```sh
$ go run constant.go
constant
6e+11
600000000000
-0.28470407323754404
```
