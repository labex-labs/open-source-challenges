# HTTP Client

## Introduction

This lab aims to test your ability to use the `net/http` package in Golang to issue HTTP requests.

You are required to write a program that sends an HTTP GET request to a server and prints the HTTP response status and the first 5 lines of the response body.

- The program should use the `net/http` package to issue an HTTP GET request.
- The program should print the HTTP response status.
- The program should print the first 5 lines of the response body.
- The program should handle errors gracefully.
