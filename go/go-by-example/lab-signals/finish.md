# Summary

The Signals lab demonstrates how to handle Unix signals in Go programs using channels. By creating a buffered channel to receive `os.Signal` notifications and registering the channel to receive notifications of specified signals using `signal.Notify`, we can gracefully handle signals and exit the program when the expected signal is received.
