# Signals

## Introduction

The Signals lab demonstrates how to handle Unix signals in Go programs using channels.

In some cases, we want our Go programs to handle Unix signals intelligently. For instance, we might want a server to shut down gracefully when it receives a `SIGTERM`, or a command-line tool to stop processing input if it receives a `SIGINT`.

- Create a buffered channel to receive `os.Signal` notifications.
- Register the channel to receive notifications of specified signals using `signal.Notify`.
- Create a goroutine to execute a blocking receive for signals.
- Print out the received signal and notify the program that it can finish.
- Wait for the expected signal and then exit.

## TODO

```go
// TODO: Create a buffered channel to receive `os.Signal` notifications.
sigs := make(chan os.Signal, 1)

// TODO: Register the channel to receive notifications of specified signals using `signal.Notify`.
signal.Notify(sigs, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

// TODO: Create a goroutine to execute a blocking receive for signals.
go func() {
    // TODO: When it gets one, print it out and then notify the program that it can finish.
    sig := <-sigs
    fmt.Println()
    fmt.Println(sig)
    done <- true
}()

// TODO: Wait for the expected signal and then exit.
<-done
```

```
$ go run signals.go
awaiting signal
^C
interrupt
exiting
```

## Summary

The Signals lab demonstrates how to handle Unix signals in Go programs using channels. By creating a buffered channel to receive `os.Signal` notifications and registering the channel to receive notifications of specified signals using `signal.Notify`, we can gracefully handle signals and exit the program when the expected signal is received.
