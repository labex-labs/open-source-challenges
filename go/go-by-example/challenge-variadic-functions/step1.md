# Variadic Functions

## Problem

In this challenge, you need to implement a function named `max` that takes an arbitrary number of integers as arguments and returns the maximum value. 

## Requirements

- The function `max` should take an arbitrary number of integers as arguments.
- The function `max` should return the maximum value of the integers passed as arguments.

## Example

```sh
$ go run variadic-functions.go 
[1 2] 3
[1 2 3] 6
[1 2 3 4] 10

# Another key aspect of functions in Go is their ability
# to form closures, which we'll look at next.
