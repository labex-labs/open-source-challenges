# Epoch

## Problem

The problem to be solved in this challenge is to write a Golang program that can calculate the number of seconds, milliseconds, or nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.

## Requirements

To complete this challenge, you need to have a basic understanding of Golang and the following requirements:

- Familiarity with the `time` package in Golang.
- Knowledge of how to use the `Unix`, `UnixMilli`, and `UnixNano` functions in the `time` package.

## Example

```sh
$ go run epoch.go
2012-10-31 16:13:58.292387 +0000 UTC
1351700038
1351700038292
1351700038292387000
2012-10-31 16:13:58 +0000 UTC
2012-10-31 16:13:58.292387 +0000 UTC

# Next we'll look at another time-related task: time
# parsing and formatting.
```
