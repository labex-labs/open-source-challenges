# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to spawn external processes in Go using the `exec` package. The program was able to spawn external processes that take no arguments or input, take arguments and print something to stdout, take input from stdin and print something to stdout, and take a full command with a string. The program also handled errors that may arise during the execution of the external processes.
