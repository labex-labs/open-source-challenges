# Golang Challenge: Range

## Introduction
The `range` keyword is used to iterate over elements in a variety of data structures in Golang. In this challenge, we will explore how to use `range` with different data structures.

## Problem
The problem to be solved in this challenge is to demonstrate how to use `range` with slices, arrays, maps, and strings.

## Requirements
To complete this challenge, you will need:
- Basic knowledge of Golang syntax
- Golang installed on your machine

## TODO
Complete the code blocks marked with `TODO` to demonstrate how to use `range` with different data structures.

## Example
```
sum: 9
index: 1
a -> apple
b -> banana
key: a
key: b
0 103
1 111
```

## Summary
In this challenge, we learned how to use `range` with slices, arrays, maps, and strings in Golang. The `range` keyword provides a convenient way to iterate over elements in different data structures.
