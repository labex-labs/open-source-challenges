# Range

## Introduction

The `range` keyword is used to iterate over elements in a variety of data structures in Golang. In this lab, we will explore how to use `range` with different data structures.

The problem to be solved in this lab is to demonstrate how to use `range` with slices, arrays, maps, and strings.

To complete this lab, you will need:

- Basic knowledge of Golang syntax
- Golang installed on your machine

## TODO

Complete the code blocks marked with `TODO` to demonstrate how to use `range` with different data structures.

```
sum: 9
index: 1
a -> apple
b -> banana
key: a
key: b
0 103
1 111
```

## Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use `range` with slices, arrays, maps, and strings in Golang. The `range` keyword provides a convenient way to iterate over elements in different data structures.
