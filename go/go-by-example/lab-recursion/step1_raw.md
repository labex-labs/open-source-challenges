# Recursion

## Introduction

This lab will test your understanding of recursive functions in Golang.

The `sum` function takes an integer slice and returns the sum of all the integers in the slice. However, the function is incomplete and needs to be implemented using recursion.

- The `sum` function must be implemented using recursion.
- The function must take an integer slice as input.
- The function must return the sum of all the integers in the slice.

## TODO

```go
func sum(nums []int) int {
    // TODO: Implement using recursion
}
```

```go
fmt.Println(sum([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5})) // Output: 15
fmt.Println(sum([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4})) // Output: 10
fmt.Println(sum([]int{-1, 0, 1})) // Output: 0
```

## Summary

In this lab, you were tasked with implementing the `sum` function using recursion. Recursion is a powerful tool that can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. By completing this lab, you should now have a better understanding of how to use recursion in Golang.
