# Channels

## Introduction

The Channels lab is designed to test your understanding of channels in Golang. Channels are used to connect concurrent goroutines, allowing values to be sent and received between them.

In this lab, you are required to create a new channel and send a value into it from a new goroutine. You will then receive the value from the channel and print it out.

- You must use the `make(chan val-type)` syntax to create a new channel.
- The channel must be typed by the values it conveys.
- You must use the `channel <-` syntax to send a value into the channel.
- You must use the `<-channel` syntax to receive a value from the channel.
- You must use a new goroutine to send the value into the channel.

## TODO

```
// Create a new channel with `make(chan val-type)`.
// Channels are typed by the values they convey.
messages := make(chan string)

// TODO: Send a value into the `messages` channel from a new goroutine.

// TODO: Receive the value from the `messages` channel and print it out.
```

## Summary

The Channels lab tests your ability to use channels in Golang to send and receive values between concurrent goroutines. By completing this lab, you will have a better understanding of how channels work and how they can be used to improve the performance of your Golang programs.
