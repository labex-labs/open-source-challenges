# Goroutines

## Introduction

This lab is designed to test your understanding of goroutines in Golang. Goroutines are lightweight threads of execution that allow for concurrent execution of functions.

The problem to be solved in this lab is to create and run goroutines to execute functions concurrently.

- The `f` function should print out its input string and a counter variable three times.
- The `main` function should call the `f` function synchronously and print out "direct" and a counter variable three times.
- The `main` function should call the `f` function asynchronously using a goroutine and print out "goroutine" and a counter variable three times.
- The `main` function should start a goroutine to execute an anonymous function that prints out a message.
- The `main` function should wait for the goroutines to finish executing before printing out "done".

## TODO

```
func f(from string) {
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		fmt.Println(from, ":", i)
	}
}

func main() {

	// Call f function synchronously
	f("direct")

	// Call f function asynchronously using a goroutine
	go f("goroutine")

	// Start a goroutine to execute an anonymous function
	go func(msg string) {
		fmt.Println(msg)
	}("going")

	// Wait for goroutines to finish executing
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println("done")
}
```

```
direct : 0
direct : 1
direct : 2
going
goroutine : 0
goroutine : 1
goroutine : 2
done
```

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to create and run goroutines to execute functions concurrently. You also learned how to start a goroutine to execute an anonymous function and how to wait for goroutines to finish executing.
