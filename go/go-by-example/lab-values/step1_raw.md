# Value Types

## Introduction

This lab aims to test your understanding of Golang's basic value types, including strings, integers, floats, and booleans.

Your task is to complete the `calculate` function that takes in two integers and returns their sum and product.

- The `calculate` function should take in two integers as parameters.
- The `calculate` function should return two integers, the sum and product of the input parameters.

## TODO

```go
func calculate(a int, b int) (int, int) {
	// TODO: Calculate the sum and product of a and b
	sum := TODO
	product := TODO
	return sum, product
}
```

```go
sum, product := calculate(2, 3)
fmt.Println(sum, product) // Output: 5 6
```

## Summary

In this lab, you were tasked with completing the `calculate` function to calculate the sum and product of two integers. By doing so, you were able to demonstrate your understanding of Golang's basic value types.
