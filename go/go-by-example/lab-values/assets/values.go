// Go has various value types including strings,
// integers, floats, booleans, etc. Here are a few
// basic examples.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // TODO
	// Strings, which can be added together with `+`.
	// Integers and floats.
	// Booleans, with boolean operators as you'd expect.
}
