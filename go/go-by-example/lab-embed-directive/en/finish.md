# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the `embed` package to embed files and folders into the Go binary at build time. You also learned how to use the `string` and `[]byte` types to store the contents of the embedded files, and how to use the `embed.FS` type to embed multiple files or folders with wildcards.
