# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to format and parse time in Golang using the `time` package. We used the `time.RFC3339` layout to format and parse time and the `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006` reference time to show the pattern with which to format/parse a given time/string. We also used the `Parse` and `Format` functions to parse and format time, respectively.
