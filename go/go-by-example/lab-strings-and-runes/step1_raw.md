# Strings and Runes

## Introduction

This lab focuses on Go strings and runes. In Go, strings are read-only slices of bytes, and runes are integers that represent Unicode code points. This lab will explore how to work with strings and runes in Go.

The problem to be solved in this lab is to understand how to work with strings and runes in Go. Specifically, the lab will cover how to get the length of a string, how to index into a string, how to count the number of runes in a string, and how to iterate over the runes in a string.

To complete this lab, you will need:

- A basic understanding of Go syntax
- Knowledge of Go strings and runes
- The Go standard library

## TODO

Complete the following code blocks marked with `TODO`:

- `examineRune` function

```
Len: 12
e0 b8 aa e0 b8 a7 e0 b8 b1 e0 b8 aa e0 b9 84
Rune count: 6
U+0E2A 'ส' starts at 0
U+0E27 'ว' starts at 3
U+0E31 'ั' starts at 6
U+0E2A 'ส' starts at 9
U+0E44 'ไ' starts at 12
U+0E19 'น' starts at 15

Using DecodeRuneInString
U+0E2A 'ส' starts at 0
found so sua
U+0E27 'ว' starts at 3
U+0E31 'ั' starts at 6
U+0E2A 'ส' starts at 9
U+0E44 'ไ' starts at 12
U+0E19 'น' starts at 15
```

## Summary

This lab covered how to work with Go strings and runes. It demonstrated how to get the length of a string, how to index into a string, how to count the number of runes in a string, and how to iterate over the runes in a string. By completing this lab, you should have a better understanding of how to work with strings and runes in Go.
