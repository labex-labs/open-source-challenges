# Interfaces

## Introduction

This lab is about interfaces in Golang. Interfaces are named collections of method signatures.

The problem is to implement an interface in Go, we just need to implement all the methods in the interface. Here we implement `geometry` on `rect`s and `circle`s.

- Implement an interface in Go.
- Implement all the methods in the interface.
- Use a generic `measure` function to work on any `geometry`.
- Use instances of `circle` and `rect` structs as arguments to `measure`.

## TODO

Use the TODO keyword to mark the code that needs to be completed.

```
// TODO: Implement the geometry interface on the rect type.
// TODO: Implement the geometry interface on the circle type.
```
