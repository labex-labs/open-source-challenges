// Go's `sort` package implements sorting for builtins
// and user-defined types. We'll look at sorting for
// builtins first.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
    // TODO
	// Sort methods are specific to the builtin type;
	// here's an example for strings. Note that sorting is
	// in-place, so it changes the given slice and doesn't
	// return a new one.
	// An example of sorting `int`s.
	// We can also use `sort` to check if a slice is
	// already in sorted order.
