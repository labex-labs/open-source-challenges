# Sorting

## Problem

The problem to be solved in this challenge is to sort slices of strings and integers using the `sort` package.

## Requirements

- The `sort` package must be imported.
- The `sort.Strings()` function must be used to sort a slice of strings.
- The `sort.Ints()` function must be used to sort a slice of integers.
- The `sort.IntsAreSorted()` function must be used to check if a slice of integers is already sorted.

## Example

```sh
# Running our program prints the sorted string and int
# slices and `true` as the result of our `AreSorted` test.
$ go run sorting.go
Strings: [a b c]
Ints: [2 4 7]
Sorted: true
```
