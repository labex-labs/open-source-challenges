// Branching with `if` and `else` in Go is

	// Here's a basic example.
	// You can have an `if` statement without an else.
	// A statement can precede conditionals; any variables
	// declared in this statement are available in the current
	// and all subsequent branches.
}

// Note that you don't need parentheses around conditions
// in Go, but that the braces are required.
