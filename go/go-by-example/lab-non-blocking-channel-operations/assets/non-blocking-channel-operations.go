// Basic sends and receives on channels are blocking.
// However, we can use `select` with a `default` clause to
// implement _non-blocking_ sends, receives, and even
// non-blocking multi-way `select`s.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // TODO
	// Here's a non-blocking receive. If a value is
	// available on `messages` then `select` will take
	// the `<-messages` `case` with that value. If not
	// it will immediately take the `default` case.
	// A non-blocking send works similarly. Here `msg`
	// cannot be sent to the `messages` channel, because
	// the channel has no buffer and there is no receiver.
	// Therefore the `default` case is selected.
	// We can use multiple `case`s above the `default`
	// clause to implement a multi-way non-blocking
	// select. Here we attempt non-blocking receives
	// on both `messages` and `signals`.
