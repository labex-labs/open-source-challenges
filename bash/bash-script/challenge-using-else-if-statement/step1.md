# Using else if statement

## Problem

The problem is to create a Bash script that uses the **else if** statement to check a user's lucky number and award prizes accordingly. The script should prompt the user to enter their lucky number and then check it against a set of predefined values. If the number matches one of the values, the script should print a message indicating the prize the user has won. If the number does not match any of the values, the script should print a message indicating that the user did not win a prize.

## Requirements

- The script should be named `elseif_example.sh`.
- The script should use the **else if** statement to check the user's lucky number.
- The script should prompt the user to enter their lucky number.
- The script should check the user's lucky number against the following values:
  - 101: 1st prize
  - 510: 2nd prize
  - 999: 3rd prize
- If the user's lucky number matches one of the values, the script should print a message indicating the prize the user has won.
- If the user's lucky number does not match any of the values, the script should print a message indicating that the user did not win a prize.
