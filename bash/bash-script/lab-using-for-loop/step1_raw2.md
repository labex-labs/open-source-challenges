# Using For Loop

## Introduction

Bash is a powerful scripting language that can be used to automate tasks in a Linux environment. One of the most commonly used constructs in Bash is the **for** loop, which allows you to iterate over a set of values and perform actions on them.

## Problem

In this challenge, you are required to create a Bash script that uses a **for** loop to iterate over a set of values and perform a specific action on each value. Your script should be able to handle any number of iterations and should output the results in a clear and concise manner.

## Requirements

To complete this challenge, you will need to have a basic understanding of Bash scripting and the **for** loop construct. You will also need access to a Linux environment where you can create and run Bash scripts.

To create your Bash script, you will need to follow these requirements:

- Use the markdown first level header for the title of your script.
- Use the markdown second level header for the Introduction, Problem, Requirements, Solution, and Summary sections.
- Create an Introduction section that provides a brief overview of the challenge and what is expected of you.
- Enrich the content of the Problem section by providing more details on what you need to accomplish.
- Use declarative sentences for the Requirements section to clearly state what is needed to complete the challenge.
- Ensure the authenticity of the content and avoid fabrication.

## Solution

To solve this challenge, you will need to create a Bash script that uses a **for** loop to iterate over a set of values and perform a specific action on each value. You can use the example script provided in the Problem section as a starting point.

Once you have created your script, you can run it using the Bash command and observe the output. You can also modify your script to perform different actions on the values or to iterate over a different set of values.

## Summary

In this challenge, you have learned how to use the **for** loop construct in Bash scripting to iterate over a set of values and perform actions on them. By following the requirements and creating your own Bash script, you have demonstrated your understanding of this concept and your ability to apply it in a practical setting.
