# Use of Echo Command

## Introduction

Bash is a popular shell used in Linux and Unix operating systems. It provides a command-line interface to interact with the system. One of the most commonly used commands in Bash is the `echo` command. In this challenge, we will explore the different options available with the `echo` command.

## Problem

Create a Bash script that demonstrates the use of the `echo` command with various options. The script should print text with and without a newline, and remove backslash characters from the output.

## Requirements

- The Bash script should be named `echo_example.sh`.
- The script should use the `echo` command with the following options:
  - Without any option (default behavior)
  - `-n` option to print text without a newline
  - `-e` option to remove backslash characters from the output
- The script should print the following text:
  - "Printing text with newline"
  - "Printing text without newline"
  - "Removing backslash characters"
- The script should be executable.

## Solution

Create a new file named `echo_example.sh` and add the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
echo "Printing text with newline"  
echo -n "Printing text without newline"  
echo -e "\nRemoving \t backslash \t characters\n"
```

Save the file and make it executable using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x echo_example.sh
```

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
./echo_example.sh
```

The output should be:

```bash
Printing text with newline
Printing text without newlineRemoving      backslash        characters
```

## Summary

In this challenge, we learned about the different options available with the `echo` command in Bash. We created a Bash script that demonstrated the use of the `echo` command with various options. We printed text with and without a newline, and removed backslash characters from the output.
