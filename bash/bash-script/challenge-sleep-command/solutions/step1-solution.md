## Solution

To use the **sleep** command, you can create a Bash script and add the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Wait for 5 seconds"
sleep 5
echo "Completed"
```

This script will display the message "Wait for 5 seconds," pause the execution for 5 seconds, and then display the message "Completed."

To run the script, save it with the name **sleep_example.sh** and run the following command:

```bash
bash sleep_example.sh
```
