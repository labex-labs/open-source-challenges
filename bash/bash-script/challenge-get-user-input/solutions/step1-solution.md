## Solution

Here is an example script that meets the requirements:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter Your Name"
read name
echo "Welcome $name to LinuxHint"
```

Save this script as 'user_input.sh' and run it with the following command:

```bash
bash user_input.sh
```

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter your name. After you enter your name, it will display a welcome message that includes your name.
