### Get User Input:

‘**read**’ command is used to take input from user in bash. Create a file named ‘**user\_input.sh**’ and add the following script for taking input from the user. Here, one string value will be taken from the user and display the value by combining other string value.

#!/bin/bash  
echo "Enter Your Name"  
read name  
echo "Welcome $name to LinuxHint"

Run the file with bash command.

$ bash user\_input.sh
