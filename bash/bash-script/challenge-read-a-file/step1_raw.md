### Read a File:

You can read any file line by line in bash by using loop. Create a file named, ‘**read\_file.sh**’ and add the following code to read an existing file named, ‘**book.txt**’.

#!/bin/bash  
file\='book.txt'  
while read line; do  
echo $line  
done < $file

Run the file with bash command.

$ bash read\_file.sh

Run the following command to check the original content of ‘**book.txt**’ file.

$ cat book.txt
