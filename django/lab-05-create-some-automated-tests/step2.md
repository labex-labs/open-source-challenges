# Basic testing strategies

There are many ways to approach writing tests.

Some programmers follow a discipline called "[test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)"; they actually write their tests before they write their code. This might seem counter-intuitive, but in fact it's similar to what most people will often do anyway: they describe a problem, then create some code to solve it. Test-driven development formalizes the problem in a Python test case.

More often, a newcomer to testing will create some code and later decide that it should have some tests. Perhaps it would have been better to write some tests earlier, but it's never too late to get started.

Sometimes it's difficult to figure out where to get started with writing tests. If you have written several thousand lines of Python, choosing something to test might not be easy. In such a case, it's fruitful to write your first test the next time you make a change, either when you add a new feature or fix a bug.

So let's do that right away.
