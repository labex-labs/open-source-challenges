# Getting help from others

At some point you will run into a problem, for example the toolbar may not render. When this happens and you're unable to resolve the issue yourself, there are options available to you.

1. If the problem is with a specific package, check if there's a troubleshooting of FAQ in the package's documentation. For example the Django Debug Toolbar has a [Tips section](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips.html) that outlines troubleshooting options.
2. Search for similar issues on the package's issue tracker. Django Debug Toolbarâ€™s is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
3. Consult the [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/).
4. Join the [Django Discord server](https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa).
5. Join the \#Django IRC channel on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/).
