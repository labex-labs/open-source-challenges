# Installing other third-party packages

There are many more third-party packages, which you can find using the fantastic Django resource, [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org/).

It can be difficult to know what third-party packages you should use. This depends on your needs and goals. Sometimes it's fine to use a package that's in its alpha state. Other times, you need to know it's production ready. [Adam Johnson has a blog post](https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/11/04/the-well-maintained-test/) that outlines a set of characteristics that qualifies a package as "well maintained". Django Packages shows data for some of these characteristics, such as when the package was last updated.

As Adam points out in his post, when the answer to one of the questions is "no", that's an opportunity to contribute.
