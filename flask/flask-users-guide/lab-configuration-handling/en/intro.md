# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to handle configuration in a Flask application. Configuration allows you to change settings in your application based on different environments, such as toggling debug mode, setting secret keys, and other environment-specific variables.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on Web 5000.
