# Run the Development Server

Instead of manually running the Flask application using `python app.py`, you can use the Flask CLI to start the development server. Stop the currently running application (if any) and execute the following command:

```
flask run
```

You should see the Flask development server start and display the URL where your application is running (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). Open that URL in your browser and you should see the "Hello, Flask!" message.
