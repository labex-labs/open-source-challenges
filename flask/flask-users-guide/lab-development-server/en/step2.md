# Run Development Server with Flask CLI

The easiest way to run the development server is to use the Flask CLI command `flask run`. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
flask run
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:5000/`. You can access your Flask application by opening a web browser and entering this URL.
