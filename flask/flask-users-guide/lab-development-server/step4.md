# Specify Application File

By default, Flask will look for a file named `app.py` to run as the Flask application. If your file has a different name or is located in a different directory, you can use the `--app` option to specify the application file:

```bash
flask run --app myapp.py
```

Replace `myapp.py` with the name of your application file.
