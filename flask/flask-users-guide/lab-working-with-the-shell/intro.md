# Introduction

The Python Flask tutorial "Working with the Shell" provides guidance on using the interactive shell in Flask to execute Python commands in real-time. This tutorial explains how to create a request context, fire before/after request functions, and improve the shell experience.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on Web 5000.
