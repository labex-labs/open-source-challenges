# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Jinja2 templates in Flask. Jinja2 is a powerful template engine that allows you to generate dynamic HTML pages in your Flask application. Templates are a great way to separate the presentation logic from the business logic of your application.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on Web 5000.
