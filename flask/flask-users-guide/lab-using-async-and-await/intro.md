# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of using `async` and `await` in Flask, a popular Python web framework. You will learn how to define asynchronous views and handlers, understand the performance implications of using async code, and explore background tasks in Flask.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
