# Using Async and Await in Flask

## Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of using `async` and `await` in Flask, a popular Python web framework. You will learn how to define asynchronous views and handlers, understand the performance implications of using async code, and explore background tasks in Flask.

## Steps

### Step 1: Defining an Async View

In Flask, you can define views as asynchronous functions using the `async def` syntax. This allows you to use `await` to perform asynchronous operations within the view function.

```python
@app.route("/get-data")
async def get_data():
    data = await async_db_query(...)
    return jsonify(data)
```

To run this code, save it in a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and execute the file using the Flask development server:

```bash
flask run
```

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use `async` and `await` in Flask to define asynchronous views and handlers. You also explored the performance implications of using async code, background tasks, and the use of Quart as an alternative to Flask for async-heavy codebases. Additionally, you learned about the compatibility of Flask extensions with async views and the possibility of using other event loops in Flask.
