# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use `async` and `await` in Flask to define asynchronous views and handlers. You also explored the performance implications of using async code, background tasks, and the use of Quart as an alternative to Flask for async-heavy codebases. Additionally, you learned about the compatibility of Flask extensions with async views and the possibility of using other event loops in Flask.
