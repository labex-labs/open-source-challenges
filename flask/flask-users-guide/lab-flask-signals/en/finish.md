# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use signals in Flask to notify subscribers of specific events during the lifecycle of the application. You created a namespace for signals, created a signal, subscribed to the signal, and emitted the signal. Signals are a powerful tool for adding functionality to your Flask application without directly modifying the application code.
