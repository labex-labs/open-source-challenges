# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to test Flask applications using the `pytest` framework. Testing is an important part of the software development process, as it helps to ensure the correctness and reliability of your application. Flask provides utilities for testing, making it easy to write tests for different parts of your application.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
