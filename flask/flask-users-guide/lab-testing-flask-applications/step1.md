# Set up the Testing Environment

Before you can start writing tests for your Flask application, you need to set up the testing environment. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Install the `pytest` framework by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Create a new file called `conftest.py` in the `tests` folder of your Flask application.

3. In the `conftest.py` file, import the necessary modules:

   ```python
   import pytest
   from my_app import create_app
   ```

4. Define a fixture named `app` that creates and configures an app instance:

   ```python
   @pytest.fixture()
   def app():
       app = create_app()
       app.config.update({
           "TESTING": True,
       })
       yield app
   ```

   Note that if you are using an application factory pattern, you should modify the fixture accordingly.

5. Define fixtures for the test client and CLI runner:

   ```python
   @pytest.fixture()
   def client(app):
       return app.test_client()

   @pytest.fixture()
   def runner(app):
       return app.test_cli_runner()
   ```
