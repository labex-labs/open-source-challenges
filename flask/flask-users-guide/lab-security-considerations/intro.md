# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore important security considerations when developing web applications using Flask. We will cover topics such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), JSON security, security headers, and secure cookie options. By following these steps, you will learn how to enhance the security of your Flask applications.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
