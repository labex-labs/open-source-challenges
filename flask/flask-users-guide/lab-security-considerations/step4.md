# Security Headers

Browsers recognize various response headers to control security. It is recommended to review and use the following security headers in your Flask application:

- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Tells the browser to convert all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Specifies where various types of resources can be loaded from.
- X-Content-Type-Options: Forces the browser to honor the response content type.
- X-Frame-Options: Prevents external sites from embedding your site in an iframe.

You can use the `Flask-Talisman` extension to manage HTTPS and security headers in your Flask application.
