# JSON Security

In Flask, it's important to ensure the security of JSON responses. In versions prior to Flask 0.10, top-level arrays were not serialized to JSON due to a security vulnerability. However, this behavior has been changed, and top-level arrays are now serialized. It is recommended to use the latest version of Flask to take advantage of this security improvement.
