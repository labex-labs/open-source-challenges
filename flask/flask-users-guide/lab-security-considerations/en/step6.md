# HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)

HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a security feature that tells the browser to authenticate with the server using only a specific certificate key. While this can enhance security, it is also difficult to undo if set up or upgraded incorrectly. Consider using HPKP with caution and ensure proper configuration.
