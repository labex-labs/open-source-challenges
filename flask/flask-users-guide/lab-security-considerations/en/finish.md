# Summary

In this lab, we explored important security considerations when developing web applications with Flask. We covered measures to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, as well as securing JSON responses and setting security headers and cookie options. By following these security practices, you can enhance the security of your Flask applications and protect user data from potential vulnerabilities.
