# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to add style to your Flask application using static files. Static files, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images, are served directly to the client without any modification. By adding CSS to your Flask application, you can enhance the visual appearance of your HTML templates.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
