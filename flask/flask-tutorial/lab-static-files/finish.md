# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to add styles to our Flask application using a CSS file. We created a CSS file, added some CSS rules, and then linked the CSS file in our HTML templates using Flask's `url_for` function. Now, our Flask application looks much more visually appealing. Remember, if you make changes to a static file, you may need to refresh the browser page or clear your browser's cache to see the changes.
