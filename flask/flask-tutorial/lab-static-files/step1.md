# Create CSS file

First, we need to create a CSS file that will hold our styles. In Flask, static files are stored in a directory named `static`. Let's create a CSS file named `style.css` in the `flaskr/static` directory.

```bash
# Navigate to the static directory
cd flaskr/static

# Create style.css file
touch style.css
```
