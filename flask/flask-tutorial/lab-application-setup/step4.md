# Running the Application

With your application set up and configured, you can now run it using the `flask` command. Be sure to run this command from the top-level `flask-tutorial` directory, not the `flaskr` package.

```bash
flask --app flaskr run --debug
```

You should see output similar to this:

```bash
 * Serving Flask app "flaskr"
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: nnn-nnn-nnn
```
