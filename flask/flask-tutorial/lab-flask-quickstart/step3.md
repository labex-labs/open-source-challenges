# Running the Application

Now that you have set up your Flask application and created a basic route, let's run the application and see it in action.

1. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located.

2. Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. You should see some output indicating that the server is running. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to see the "Hello, World!" message.
