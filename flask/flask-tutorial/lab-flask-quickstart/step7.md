# Running the Application Again

Let's run the application again and test the dynamic content feature.

1. Stop the Flask development server if it is still running (press Ctrl+C).

2. Run the following command to start the server again:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:5000/John` in your web browser. You should now see a personalized greeting that says "Hello, John!".
