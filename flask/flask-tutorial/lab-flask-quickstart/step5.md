# Running the Application Again

Now that we have added an HTML template, let's run the application again and see the rendered template.

1. Stop the Flask development server if it is still running (press Ctrl+C).

2. Run the following command to start the server again:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. You should now see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in the HTML template.
