# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to set up a Flask project directory. We started by creating a new project directory, installing Flask, setting up a basic Flask app, organizing the project into packages, and finally, setting up a version control system. Now you are ready to continue developing your Flask application with a well-structured project directory.
