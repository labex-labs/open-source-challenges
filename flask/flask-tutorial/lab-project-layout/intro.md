# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a directory layout for a Flask project. We will be setting up a Flask application with a structured directory, which will include various files and packages needed for a Flask project. This layout is beneficial for managing larger projects.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
