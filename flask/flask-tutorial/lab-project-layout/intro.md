# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a project layout for a Python Flask application. A well-organized project structure makes it easier to manage and scale your application as it grows. By the end of this lab, you will have a clear understanding of how to structure your Flask projects effectively.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
