# Running the Application

Now that you have set up your Flask application and created a basic route, let's run the application and see it in action.

1. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located.
2. Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0
   ```

`--host=0.0.0.0` is used to make the application publicly available. If you don't specify this, the application will only be available on your local machine.

Then, switch to the tab **HTTP 5000** and refresh the page.
