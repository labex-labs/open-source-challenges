# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of getting started with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. You will learn how to create a basic Flask application, run it locally, and understand the basic concepts of routing and rendering templates.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
