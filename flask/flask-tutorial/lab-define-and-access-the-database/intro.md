# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to define and access a database in a Flask application. We will be using SQLite as our database, which is a built-in database in Python. SQLite is convenient because it doesn't require setting up a separate database server. However, for larger applications, you may want to consider switching to a different database.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
