# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create and use templates in Flask. We created a base layout that includes the common elements of our application, and then we created specific templates for the registration and login pages that extend this base layout and fill in their specific content. This allows us to keep our code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), making it more maintainable and less prone to errors.
