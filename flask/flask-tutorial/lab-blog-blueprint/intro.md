# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to implement a blog blueprint using Flask. The blog blueprint will allow users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. We will cover the following steps:

1. Define and register the blueprint
2. Implement the index view to display all posts
3. Implement the create view to allow users to create new posts
4. Implement the update view to allow users to edit existing posts
5. Implement the delete view to allow users to delete posts

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
