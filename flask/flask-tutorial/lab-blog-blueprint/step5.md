# Implement the delete view

In the `blog.py` file, add the following code to implement the delete view:

```python
@bp.route('/<int:id>/delete', methods=('POST',))
@login_required
def delete(id):
    get_post(id)
    db = get_db()
    db.execute('DELETE FROM post WHERE id = ?', (id,))
    db.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('blog.index'))
```
