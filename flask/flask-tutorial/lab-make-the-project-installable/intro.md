# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to make your Python Flask project installable. Making your project installable allows you to build a wheel file, which can then be installed in any other environment. This makes it easier to deploy your project and use standard Python tools for managing dependencies.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
