# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to make a Python Flask project installable. This will make the project deployable and manageable using standard Python tools. This process is beneficial as it allows the project to be installed in different environments, manage dependencies, and isolate test environments.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
