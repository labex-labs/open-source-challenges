# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to define and access a SQLite database using the Python Flask framework. We will set up a SQLite database, establish a connection with it, create tables, and initialize the database.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on Web 5000.
