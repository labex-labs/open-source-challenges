# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use templates in Flask to render dynamic HTML pages. We created a base template and a child template, and used the `render_template` function to render the child template. Templates allow us to separate the presentation logic from the business logic in our Flask application, making our code more modular and maintainable.
