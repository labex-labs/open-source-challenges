# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use templates in Flask to render dynamic HTML pages. Templates allow us to separate the presentation logic from the business logic in our Flask application, making our code more modular and maintainable.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
