# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to deploy a Flask application to a server. We will create a distribution file for our application and install it on the server. The lab assumes you have a basic understanding of Flask, Python's virtual environments, and the command line.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
