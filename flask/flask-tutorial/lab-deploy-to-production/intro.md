# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a Python Flask application to a production server. It covers building and installing the application, configuring the secret key, and running the application with a production server.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
