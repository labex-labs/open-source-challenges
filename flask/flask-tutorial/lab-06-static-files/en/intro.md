# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to add CSS to our Flask application to make it visually appealing. We will use static files, specifically a CSS file, to style our application. Static files are files that don't change, such as CSS files, JavaScript files, and images.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on Web 5000.
