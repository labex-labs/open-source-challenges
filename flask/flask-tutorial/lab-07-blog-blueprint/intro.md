# Introduction

In this lab, we'll walk through creating a blog application using Flask, a popular web framework in Python. This application will list all blog posts, allow logged-in users to create posts, and let authors edit or delete their own posts.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
