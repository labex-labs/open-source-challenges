# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about test coverage in Flask applications. Test coverage is a measure of how much of your code is covered by your tests. It helps ensure that your code works as expected and can help identify areas of your code that are not being tested.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
