# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to write unit tests for a Flask application. We will use `pytest` and `coverage` to test and measure our code. By the end of this lab, you will understand how to ensure your application works as expected and identify areas that need improvement.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
