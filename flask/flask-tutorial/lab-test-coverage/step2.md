# Writing Unit Tests

Unit tests are used to check that individual parts of your code work as expected. In Flask, you can use the test client provided by Flask to simulate requests to your application and verify the response data.

You should aim to test as much of your code as possible. This includes testing different branches of your code, such as if statements, to ensure that all possible paths are covered.
