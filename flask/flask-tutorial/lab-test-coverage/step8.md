# Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ pytest
```

This will run all the test functions you've written and display the results. If any tests fail, pytest will show the error that was raised.

To measure the code coverage of your tests, use the following command:

```bash
$ coverage run -m pytest
```

This will run pytest with coverage measurement enabled. You can then generate a coverage report by running the following command:

```bash
$ coverage report
```

This will display a report showing the coverage of your code.
