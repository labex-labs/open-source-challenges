# Run the Tests

Now that we have written our tests, we can run them using the `pytest` command:

```bash
pytest
```

To measure the code coverage of your tests, use the `coverage` command to run pytest:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

You can view a simple coverage report in the terminal with the following command:

```bash
coverage report
```
