# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating and using blueprints and views in Flask. Blueprints are a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Views are the code that responds to requests made to your Flask application.

> Note: You need to create the code file yourself and run it in the environment. You can preview the Flask service status on HTTP 5000.
