# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to use Flask blueprints to structure our application. We have created a blueprint for user authentication and implemented registration, login, and logout views. We also implemented a decorator to protect views that require a user to be logged in. With this knowledge, you can now structure your Flask applications in a modular and scalable manner.
