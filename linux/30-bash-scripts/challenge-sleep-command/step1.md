# Sleep Command

## Problem

Suppose you want to pause the execution of a command for a specific period of time. In that case, you can use the **sleep** command. The syntax of the command is as follows:

```bash
sleep [NUMBER[SUFFIX]]
```

Here, **NUMBER** is the amount of time you want to pause the execution, and **SUFFIX** is the unit of time. You can use **s** for seconds, **m** for minutes, **h** for hours, and **d** for days.

For example, if you want to pause the execution for 5 seconds, you can use the following command:

```bash
sleep 5s
```

## Requirements

To complete this challenge, you need to have a basic understanding of Bash commands and how to create and run Bash scripts. You also need to have access to a Linux or Unix operating system.

## Example

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
bash sleep_example.sh
```

Output:

```bash
Wait for 5 seconds
Completed
```
