# Get Arguments from Command Line with Names

## Problem

Create a Bash script named `command_line_names.sh` that reads two arguments, `X` and `Y`, from the command line and prints their sum. The script should be able to handle arguments passed in any order and should gracefully handle any errors or missing arguments.
