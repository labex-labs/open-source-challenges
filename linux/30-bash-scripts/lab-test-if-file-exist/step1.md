# Test if File Exist

## Problem

Create a Bash script named 'file_exist.sh' that takes a filename as an argument and checks if the file exists in the current location. If the file exists, the script should print "File exists" and if the file does not exist, the script should print "File does not exist". 

## Requirements

- The script should be named 'file_exist.sh'.
- The script should take a filename as an argument.
- The script should use the '-f' option to check the file existence.
- If the file exists, the script should print "File exists".
- If the file does not exist, the script should print "File does not exist".

## Solution

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
filename=$1  
if [ -f "$filename" ]; then  
echo "File exists"  
else  
echo "File does not exist"  
fi
```
Save the above code in a file named 'file_exist.sh'. Run the following commands to check the existence of the file. Here, **book.txt** file exists andÂ  **book2.txt** is not exist in the current location.

```bash
ls  
bash file_exist.sh book.txt  
bash file_exist.sh book2.txt
```
