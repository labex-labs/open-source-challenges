# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to check the existence of a file in Bash using the '-f' option. We created a Bash script that takes a filename as an argument and checks if the file exists in the current location. If the file exists, the script prints "File exists" and if the file does not exist, the script prints "File does not exist".
