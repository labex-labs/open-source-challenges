### Delete a File:

‘**rm**’ command is used in bash to remove any file. Create a file named ‘**delete\_file.sh**’ with the following code to take the filename from the user and remove. Here, **‘-i’** option is used to get permission from the user before removing the file.

#!/bin/bash  
echo "Enter filename to remove"  
read fn  
rm \-i $fn

Run the file with bash command.

$ ls  
$ bash delete\_file.sh  
$ ls
