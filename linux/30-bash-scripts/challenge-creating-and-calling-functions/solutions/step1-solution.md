## Solution

To create the function, open a new file named `function_example.sh` and add the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
function F1()  
{  
echo 'I like bash programming'  
}  
  
F1
```

Save the file and run it using the `bash` command:

```bash
bash function_example.sh
```

The output should be:

```bash
I like bash programming
```
