# Create Function with Parameters

## Problem

Create a Bash script named `function_parameter.sh`, containing a function called `Rectangle_Area`. The function should calculate the area of a rectangle based on two passed-in parameters, which will be represented as $1 and $2 within the function itself. After defining the function, call it with two sample parameters (e.g. 10 and 20).

## Requirements

To successfully complete this challenge, the script should:

* Declare a function named `Rectangle_Area`
* Read in two parameters (e.g. width and height)
* Calculate the area of a rectangle based on the provided parameters
* Print the result
* Call the `Rectangle_Area` function with two sample parameters (e.g. 10 and 20)
