## Solution

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
echo "Total arguments : $#"  
echo "1st Argument = $1"  
echo "2nd argument = $2"
```

Save the script as "command_line.sh" and run it using the bash command.

```bash
bash command_line.sh Linux Hint
```

The output should be:

```bash
Total arguments : 2
1st Argument = Linux
2nd argument = Hint
```
