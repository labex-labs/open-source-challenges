## Summary


In this challenge, we learned how to use the **else if** statement in Bash to check a user's lucky number and award prizes accordingly. We also learned how to prompt the user for input and how to use conditional statements to control the flow of the script. With these skills, we can create more complex Bash scripts to automate tasks and manage system configurations.
