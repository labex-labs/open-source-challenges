# Get Arguments from Command Line with Names

## Problem

Create a Bash script named `command_line_names.sh` that reads two arguments, `X` and `Y`, from the command line and prints their sum. The script should be able to handle arguments passed in any order and should gracefully handle any errors or missing arguments.

## Requirements

- The script must be named `command_line_names.sh`.
- The script must read two arguments, `X` and `Y`, from the command line.
- The script must be able to handle arguments passed in any order.
- The script must gracefully handle any errors or missing arguments.
- The script must print the sum of `X` and `Y`.

## Solution

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
for arg in "$@"  
do  
    index=$(echo $arg | cut -f1 -d=)  
    val=$(echo $arg | cut -f2 -d=)  
    case $index in  
        X) x=$val;;  
        Y) y=$val;;  
        *) ;;
    esac  
done  
((result=x+y))  
echo "X+Y=$result"
```

To run the script, use the following command with two command line arguments:

```bash
bash command_line_names.sh X=45 Y=30
```
