# Use of Comment in Bash Scripting

## Introduction

In Bash scripting, comments are used to add notes or explanations to the code. These comments are ignored by the interpreter and are only meant for human readers. 

## Problem

The problem is to understand how to use comments in Bash scripting. 

## Requirements

To add comments in Bash scripting, use the `#` symbol at the beginning of the line. The comment can be a single line or multiple lines. It is recommended to use comments to explain the purpose of the code, add notes, or provide instructions. 

## Solution

To demonstrate the use of comments, create a new file named `comment_example.sh` and add the following script with a single-line comment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash  

# Add two numeric values  
((sum=25+35))  

# Print the result  
echo $sum
```

Save the file and run it with the `bash` command:

```bash
bash comment_example.sh
```

The output will be:

```bash
60
```
