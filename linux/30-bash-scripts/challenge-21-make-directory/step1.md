# Make Directory

## Problem

Create a Bash script named `make_directory.sh` that takes a new directory name from the user. If the directory name does not exist in the current location, the script should create the directory. Otherwise, the script should display an error message.

## Requirements

- The Bash script should be named `make_directory.sh`.
- The script should take a new directory name from the user.
- If the directory name does not exist in the current location, the script should create the directory.
- If the directory name already exists in the current location, the script should display an error message.

## Example

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
bash make_directory.sh
```

Output:

```bash
Enter directory name
new_directory
Directory created successfully
```
