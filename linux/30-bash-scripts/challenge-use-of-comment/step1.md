# Use of Comment in Bash Scripting

## Problem

The problem is to understand how to use comments in Bash scripting.

## Requirements

To add comments in Bash scripting, use the `#` symbol at the beginning of the line. The comment can be a single line or multiple lines. It is recommended to use comments to explain the purpose of the code, add notes, or provide instructions.

## Example

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
bash comment_example.sh
```

Output:

```bash
60
```
