## Solution

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
echo "Enter directory name"  
read newdir  
if [ ! -d "$newdir" ]; then
    mkdir "$newdir"
    echo "Directory created successfully"
else
    echo "Error: Directory already exists"
fi
```

Save the above code in a file named `make_directory.sh`. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
bash make_directory.sh
```
