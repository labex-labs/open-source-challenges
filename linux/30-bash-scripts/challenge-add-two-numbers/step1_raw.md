### Add Two Numbers:

You can do the arithmetical operations in bash in different ways. How you can add two integer numbers in bash using double brackets is shown in the following script. Create a file named ‘**add\_numbers.sh**’ with the following code. Two integer values will be taken from the user and printed the result of addition.

#!/bin/bash  
echo "Enter first number"  
read x  
echo "Enter second number"  
read y  
(( sum\=x+y ))  
echo "The result of addition=$sum"

Run the file with bash command.

$ bash add\_numbers.sh
