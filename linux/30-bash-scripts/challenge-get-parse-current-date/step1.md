# Get Parse Current Date

## Problem

Create a Bash script named `date_parse.sh` that will separate the day, month, year, hour, minute, and second values of the current system date and time. The script should output the current date and time in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` and `HH:MM:SS`, respectively.

## Requirements

- The Bash script should be named `date_parse.sh`.
- The script should use the `date` command to get the current system date and time value.
- The script should parse the day, month, year, hour, minute, and second values using the `date` command.
- The script should output the current date and time in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` and `HH:MM:SS`, respectively.

## Example

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
bash date_parse.sh
```

Output:

```bash
Tue Aug 31 14:30:00 PDT 2021
Current Date is: 31-08-2021
Current Time is: 14:30:00
```
