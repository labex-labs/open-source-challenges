# Using if statement with AND logic

## Introduction

In Bash, if statements can be used with multiple conditions. This challenge demonstrates how to define multiple conditions in an if statement using AND logic.

## Problem

Create a Bash script named **if_with_AND.sh** that prompts the user to enter a username and password. The script will then compare the entered values with the strings "admin" and "secret" respectively. If both values match, the output will be "valid user". Otherwise, the output will be "invalid user".

## Requirements

- The Bash script must be named **if_with_AND.sh**
- The script must prompt the user to enter a username and password
- The script must use the AND operator (&&) to compare the entered values with "admin" and "secret" respectively
- If both values match, the output must be "valid user"
- Otherwise, the output must be "invalid user"

## Solution

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter username"
read username
echo "Enter password"
read password

if [[ ( $username == "admin" && $password == "secret" ) ]]; then
    echo "valid user"
else
    echo "invalid user"
fi
```

## Summary

This challenge demonstrated how to use the AND operator in an if statement in Bash. By comparing two or more conditions using the && operator, we can create more complex logical statements in our scripts.
