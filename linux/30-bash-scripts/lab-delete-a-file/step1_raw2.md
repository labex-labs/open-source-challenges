# Delete a File

## Introduction

Bash is a command-line interface used in Linux and Unix-based operating systems. It provides a powerful set of tools to perform various tasks, including file management. In this challenge, we will focus on deleting a file using Bash.

## Problem

You need to delete a file using Bash. The file name will be provided by the user, and the script should prompt for confirmation before deleting the file.

## Requirements

To complete this challenge, you need to have a basic understanding of Bash scripting and file management. You should also have access to a Linux or Unix-based operating system.

To delete a file using Bash, you can use the `rm` command followed by the file name. To prompt for confirmation before deleting the file, you can use the `-i` option with the `rm` command.

## Solution

Create a file named `delete_file.sh` with the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash  
echo "Enter filename to remove"  
read fn  
rm -i $fn
```

Save the file and run it using the following commands:

```bash
ls  
bash delete_file.sh  
ls
```

The script will prompt you to enter the filename you want to delete. Once you enter the filename, it will ask for confirmation before deleting the file.

## Summary

In this challenge, we learned how to delete a file using Bash. We used the `rm` command with the `-i` option to prompt for confirmation before deleting the file. Bash provides a powerful set of tools for file management, making it a popular choice for developers and system administrators.
