# Delete a File

You need to delete a file using Bash. The file name will be provided by the user, and the script should prompt for confirmation before deleting the file.

To complete this lab, you need to have a basic understanding of Bash scripting and file management. You should also have access to a Linux or Unix-based operating system.

To delete a file using Bash, you can use the `rm` command followed by the file name. To prompt for confirmation before deleting the file, you can use the `-i` option with the `rm` command.

Create a file named `delete_file.sh` with the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter filename to remove"
read fn
rm -i $fn
```

Save the file and run it using the following commands:

```bash
ls
bash delete_file.sh
ls
```

The script will prompt you to enter the filename you want to delete. Once you enter the filename, it will ask for confirmation before deleting the file.
