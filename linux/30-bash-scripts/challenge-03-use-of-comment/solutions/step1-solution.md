# Solution

To demonstrate the use of comments, create a new file named `comment_example.sh` and add the following script with a single-line comment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Add two numeric values
((sum = 25 + 35))

# Print the result
echo $sum
```

Save the file and run it with the `bash` command:

```bash
bash comment_example.sh
```

The output will be:

```bash
60
```
