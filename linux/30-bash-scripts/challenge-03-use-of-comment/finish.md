# Summary

In Bash scripting, comments are used to add notes or explanations to the code. They are ignored by the interpreter and are only meant for human readers. To add comments, use the `#` symbol at the beginning of the line. It is recommended to use comments to explain the purpose of the code, add notes, or provide instructions.
