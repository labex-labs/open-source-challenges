# Creating Shell Variables

To create a shell variable, you need to assign a value to it. The variable name is case sensitive and can consist of letters and the underscore "\_". No space is permitted on either side of the `=` sign when initializing variables.

Let's create a file named `~/project/variables.sh` and add the following content:

```bash
PRICE_PER_APPLE=5
MyFirstLetters=ABC
greeting='Hello        world!'
```
