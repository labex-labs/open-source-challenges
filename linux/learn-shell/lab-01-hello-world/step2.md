# Add the Shebang and Comment

The first line of the shell script file is called the "shebang". It specifies the shell interpreter to be used for executing the script. In this case, we will use Bash.

Add the following line at the beginning of the `hello.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

This line tells the operating system that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
