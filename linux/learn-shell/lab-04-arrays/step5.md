# Access the second name in the NAMES array

To access the second name in the `NAMES` array, we can use the brackets operator `[ ]`. Remember that array indices start at 0, so the second name would have an index of 1. Add the following code to assign the second name to the `second_name` variable:

```shell
second_name=${NAMES[1]}
```
