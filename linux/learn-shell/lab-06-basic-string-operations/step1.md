# String Length

To get the length of a string, use the `${#STRING}` syntax.

Here's an example:

```bash
STRING="this is a string"
echo ${#STRING}    # Outputs: 16
```

Create a new file and save it with `~/project/string-operations.sh`.

```bash
cd ~/project
chmod +x string-operations.sh
./string-operations.sh
```

```text
16
```
