# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use pipelines in shell programming to chain commands and process complex inputs. You used the `cat`, `grep`, and `wc` commands to access CPU information, filter relevant lines, and count the number of processors. Pipelines are a powerful tool for efficient data processing in shell scripts.
