# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use loops in Bash scripting. The `for`, `while`, and `until` loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. You also learned about the `break` and `continue` statements, which help you control the loop execution. With this knowledge, you can write more efficient and flexible Bash scripts.
