# Summary

Unsupervised dimensionality reduction is a useful technique to reduce the number of features in a dataset before applying supervised learning algorithms. In this tutorial, we learned about pipelining, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), random projections, and feature agglomeration. These techniques help to reduce the dimensionality of data and improve the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models.
