# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about unsupervised dimensionality reduction and how it can be useful in machine learning tasks with a high number of features. Dimensionality reduction helps to reduce the number of features in a dataset by finding a lower-dimensional representation that still retains the important information. This can be done using unsupervised learning methods, which do not require labeled data.
