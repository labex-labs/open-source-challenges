# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` submodule in scikit-learn. This module provides utilities for calculating pairwise distances and affinities between sets of samples.

We will learn about different pairwise metrics and kernels, their definitions, and how to use them in scikit-learn.

> You can write code in `40-pairwise-metrics-affinities-and-kernels.ipynb`.
