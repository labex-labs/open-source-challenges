# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use LDA and QDA classifiers using scikit-learn. We visualized the decision boundaries for the classifiers and performed dimensionality reduction using LDA. LDA is useful for its closed-form solution and the ability to perform dimensionality reduction, while QDA is more flexible in modeling non-linear decision boundaries. Both classifiers have no hyperparameters to tune, making them easy to use in practice.
