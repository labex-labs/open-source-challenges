# Introduction

This lab compares the timing of two clustering algorithms, BIRCH and MiniBatchKMeans, on a synthetic dataset. Both algorithms are scalable and can efficiently cluster large datasets. The synthetic dataset has 25,000 samples and two features generated using make_blobs.

> In this lab, You can write code in IPython or in `lab.ipynb`.
