# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to compute the Lasso Path along the regularization parameter using the LARS algorithm on the diabetes dataset. The Lasso Path is a plot of the coefficients of a linear model as the L1 regularization parameter is increased. Each color represents a different feature of the coefficient vector, and this is displayed as a function of the regularization parameter.
