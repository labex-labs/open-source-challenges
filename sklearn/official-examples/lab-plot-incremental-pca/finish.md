# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) algorithm to perform dimensionality reduction on the Iris dataset. We compared the results of IPCA with traditional PCA and visualized the transformed data on a scatter plot. IPCA is useful when the dataset is too large to fit into memory and requires an incremental approach.
