# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore semi-supervised classifiers on the Iris dataset. We will compare the decision boundaries generated by Label Spreading, Self-training, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the Iris dataset. We will use scikit-learn, a popular Python machine learning library, to implement the classifiers and visualize the decision boundaries.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
