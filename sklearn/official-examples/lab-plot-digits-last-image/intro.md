# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the scikit-learn digits dataset. This dataset consists of 1797 8x8 pixel images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0-9. Our goal is to analyze this dataset and understand how we can utilize it to classify handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms.
