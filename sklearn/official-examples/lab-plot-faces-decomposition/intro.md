# Introduction

This lab applies different unsupervised matrix decomposition (dimension reduction) methods from the module `sklearn.decomposition` to the Olivetti faces dataset. The Olivetti faces dataset consists of 400 faces of size 64x64 pixels from 40 individuals, each captured with different facial expressions and lighting conditions.
