# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the Affinity Propagation algorithm to perform clustering on a dataset. The Affinity Propagation algorithm is a clustering algorithm that does not require the number of clusters to be predefined, and it is able to automatically determine the number of clusters based on the input data.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
