# Introduction

In this lab, we will use a Voting Regressor to predict the progression of diabetes in patients. We will use three different regressors to predict the data: Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression. Then the above 3 regressors will be used for the Voting Regressor. Finally, we will plot the predictions made by all models for comparison.

We will work with the diabetes dataset which consists of 10 features collected from a cohort of diabetes patients. The target is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.
