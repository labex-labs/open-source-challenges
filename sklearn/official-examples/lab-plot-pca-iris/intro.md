# Introduction

In this lab, we will perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset using Python scikit-learn. PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. In simpler terms, it helps to identify the most important features in a dataset and discard the less important ones. The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and contains information about the physical attributes of three different types of Iris flowers.
