# Introduction

K-means is a clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into k clusters, where each point belongs to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it. The choice of initialization method for k-means can greatly impact the algorithm's performance and convergence. In this lab, we will evaluate the impact of different initialization methods on k-means clustering algorithm's convergence robustness.
