# Introduction

The L1-Logistic Regression model is a binary classification method that uses L1 regularization to induce sparsity in the model. The regularization path of this model shows the coefficients of the model as regularization strength increases. In this lab, we will use the Iris dataset to train L1-penalized logistic regression models and plot their regularization paths.
