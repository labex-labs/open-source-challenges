# Introduction

In this lab, we will be analyzing the graph of links inside Wikipedia articles to rank articles by relative importance according to the eigenvector centrality. The traditional way to compute the principal eigenvector is to use the power iteration method. Here we will be using Martinsson's Randomized SVD algorithm implemented in scikit-learn.
