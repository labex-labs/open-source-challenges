# Introduction

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together. It starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then combines these clusters iteratively based on their similarity until all data points belong to a single cluster. In this lab, we will explore the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local structure in the data.
