# Introduction

In machine learning, validation curves are used to determine the training and validation scores of a classifier for different hyperparameter values. This can help in selecting the best hyperparameters for a model. In this lab, we will use scikit-learn to plot validation curves for a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.
