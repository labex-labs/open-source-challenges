# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. We will be using the Scikit-Learn library in Python to perform this task. Feature selection is an important step in machine learning to improve model performance by removing irrelevant or redundant features.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
