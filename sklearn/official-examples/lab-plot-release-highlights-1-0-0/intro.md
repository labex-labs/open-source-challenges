# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a quantile regression model using scikit-learn. Quantile regression estimates the median or other quantiles of y conditional on X, while ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates the conditional mean.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
