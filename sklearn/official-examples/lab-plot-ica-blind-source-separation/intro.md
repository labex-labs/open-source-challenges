# Introduction

In this lab, we will use FastICA to perform blind source separation on a mixed signal. Blind source separation is a technique used to separate mixed signals into their original independent components. This is useful in various fields such as signal processing, image processing, and data analysis. We will use Python's scikit-learn library to perform ICA and PCA on a sample mixed signal.
