# Introduction

This is a step-by-step tutorial to demonstrate the effect of monotonic constraints on a gradient boosting estimator. Gradient boosting is a popular machine learning technique used for regression and classification tasks. In this tutorial, we will build an artificial dataset and use a gradient boosting estimator to demonstrate the effect of monotonic constraints on the model's predictions.
