# Introduction

This lab compares different anomaly detection algorithms on two-dimensional datasets. The datasets contain one or two modes (regions of high density) to illustrate the ability of algorithms to cope with multimodal data. For each dataset, 15% of samples are generated as random uniform noise. Decision boundaries between inliers and outliers are displayed in black except for Local Outlier Factor (LOF) as it has no predict method to be applied on new data when it is used for outlier detection.
