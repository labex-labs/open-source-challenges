# Introduction

In this lab, we will be using Python's scikit-learn library to perform hierarchical clustering on a few toy datasets. Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering where you build a hierarchy of clusters, either in a top-down or bottom-up fashion. The goal of hierarchical clustering is to find clusters of points that are similar to each other, and dissimilar to points in other clusters.
