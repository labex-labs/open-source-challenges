# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to transform features into a higher dimensional, sparse space using an ensemble of trees. We will then train a linear model on these features. We will use different types of ensemble methods including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and compare their performance.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
