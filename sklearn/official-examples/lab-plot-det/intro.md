# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about Detection Error Tradeoff (DET) curves and compare them with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. DET curves are a variation of ROC curves, where False Negative Rate (FNR) is plotted on the y-axis instead of the True Positive Rate (TPR). We will use scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning, to generate synthetic data and compare the statistical performance of two classifiers across thresholds using ROC and DET curves.
