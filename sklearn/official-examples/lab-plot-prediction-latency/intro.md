# Introduction

The prediction latency of machine learning models is a crucial factor in real-world applications. In this lab, we will use Scikit-Learn estimators to benchmark the prediction latency of various regressors. We will measure the latency when doing predictions either in bulk or atomic mode. The plots will represent the distribution of the prediction latency as a boxplot.
