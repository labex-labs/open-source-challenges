# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the characteristics of different clustering algorithms on datasets that are "interesting" but still in 2D. The parameters of each of these dataset-algorithm pairs have been tuned to produce good clustering results. While these examples give some intuition about the algorithms, this intuition might not apply to very high dimensional data.
