# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create visualizations with display objects using scikit-learn. Display objects are classes that allow us to create visualizations directly from their respective metrics. In this lab, we will use the `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`, `RocCurveDisplay`, and `PrecisionRecallDisplay` display objects to create visualizations for a binary classification problem.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
