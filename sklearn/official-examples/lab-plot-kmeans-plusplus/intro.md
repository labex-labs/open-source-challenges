# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about K-Means++ initialization using the scikit-learn library in Python. K-Means++ is a popular algorithm for clustering data into groups based on similarities. It is used as the default initialization for k-means. In this lab, we will generate sample data, calculate seeds from k-means++, and plot the init seeds alongside the sample data.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
