# Introduction

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering method used to group similar objects together. It starts with each object as its own cluster, and then iteratively merges the most similar clusters together until a stopping criterion is met. In this lab, we will demonstrate the effect of different metrics on the hierarchical clustering using agglomerative clustering algorithm.
