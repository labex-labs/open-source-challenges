# Introduction

This lab is a step-by-step tutorial on how to use classification techniques on the Digits dataset using scikit-learn. In this lab, we will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split the dataset into training and testing sets, and then use two different classification techniques (K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression) to classify the digits. Finally, we will compare the accuracy of both techniques.
