# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the performance of two regression models, HuberRegressor and Ridge, on a dataset with strong outliers. We will generate a toy dataset, add strong outliers to it, and then fit both models to the dataset. We will visualize the results and compare the performance of the models.
