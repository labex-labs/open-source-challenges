# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use LabelPropagation to learn the labels of unknown samples from labeled samples. We will generate a dataset containing two concentric circles and assign labels to each sample. Then, we will use LabelPropagation to learn the labels of the unknown samples.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
