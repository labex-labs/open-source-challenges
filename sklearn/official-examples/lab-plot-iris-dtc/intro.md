# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Iris dataset and decision trees to classify the types of iris flowers. We will first visualize the decision boundaries of decision trees trained on pairs of features of the Iris dataset. Next, we will display the structure of a single decision tree trained on all the features of the Iris dataset.
