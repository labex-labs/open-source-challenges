# Introduction

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the Precision-Recall metric to evaluate classifier output quality. The Precision-Recall curve is a useful measure of success of prediction when the classes are very imbalanced. In information retrieval, precision is a measure of result relevancy, while recall is a measure of how many truly relevant results are returned.
