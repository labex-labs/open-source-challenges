# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to precompute the gram matrix while using weighted samples with an ElasticNet. It is important to note that if weighted samples are used, the design matrix must be centered and then rescaled by the square root of the weight vector before the gram matrix is computed.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
