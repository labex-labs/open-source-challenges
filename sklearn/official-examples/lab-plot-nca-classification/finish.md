# Summary

In this lab, we compared With and Without Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA). We used the Iris dataset to plot the class decision boundaries given by a Nearest Neighbors classifier when using the Euclidean distance on the original features, versus using the Euclidean distance after the transformation learned by NCA. We used scikit-learn to perform the nearest neighbors classification and NCA. We also used matplotlib to plot the class decision boundaries. We found that NCA improved the classification accuracy.
