# Introduction

Feature scaling is an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. It involves rescaling each feature such that it has a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0. In this lab, we will explore the importance of feature scaling and its effect on machine learning models using the scikit-learn library in Python.
