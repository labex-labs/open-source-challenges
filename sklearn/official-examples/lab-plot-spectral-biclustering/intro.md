# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Spectral Biclustering algorithm to cluster data by simultaneously considering both the rows (samples) and columns (features) of a matrix. It aims to identify patterns not only between samples but also within subsets of samples, allowing for the detection of localized structure within the data. This makes spectral biclustering particularly well-suited for datasets where the order or arrangement of features is fixed, such as in images, time series, or genomes. We will use the scikit-learn library to generate checkerboard dataset and bicluster it using the Spectral Biclustering algorithm.
