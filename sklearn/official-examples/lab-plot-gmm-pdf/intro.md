# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to generate a Gaussian mixture dataset. We will then fit a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the dataset and plot the density estimation of the mixture of Gaussians. GMMs can be used to model and estimate the probability distribution of a dataset.
