# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to concatenate multiple feature extraction methods using Python's scikit-learn library. We will use the `FeatureUnion` transformer to combine features obtained by PCA and univariate selection. Combining features using this transformer has the benefit that it allows cross-validation and grid searches over the whole process.

> You can write code in `lab.ipynb`.
