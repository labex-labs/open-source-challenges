# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm to fit a dataset that follows a noisy sine curve. We will use two different types of Gaussian Mixture Models, namely the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model with a Dirichlet process prior.
