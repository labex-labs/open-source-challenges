# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to classify data. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that is widely used in machine learning for classification and regression analysis. The idea behind SVM is to find the best hyperplane that separates the data into classes with the largest possible margin. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm that is used to find the best parameters for the SVM algorithm.
