# Introduction

This lab focuses on the use of Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for classification of handwritten digits. The RBM feature extractor is combined with a logistic regression classifier to predict the digits. The dataset used is a greyscale image data where pixel values can be interpreted as degrees of blackness on a white background.
