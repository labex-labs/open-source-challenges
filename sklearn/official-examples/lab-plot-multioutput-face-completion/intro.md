# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use multi-output estimators to complete images. The goal is to predict the lower half of a face given its upper half. Different algorithms such as extremely randomized trees, k-nearest neighbors, linear regression, and ridge regression will be used to complete the lower half of the faces. The completed faces will be compared with the original faces to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
