# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Scikit-Learn's `VotingClassifier` to predict the class of iris flowers based on two features. We will compare the predictions of `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, and `SVC` classifiers individually, and then use `VotingClassifier` to combine their predictions and see if we get better results.
