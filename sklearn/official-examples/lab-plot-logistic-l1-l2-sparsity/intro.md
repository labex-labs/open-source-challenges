# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the sparsity of solutions when L1, L2, and Elastic-Net penalty are used for different values of C. We will use logistic regression to classify 8x8 images of digits into two classes: 0-4 against 5-9. We will visualize the coefficients of the models for varying C.
