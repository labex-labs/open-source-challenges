# Introduction

Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating machine learning models by training several models on different subsets of the available data and evaluating them on the complementary subset. This helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that the model is generalizable. In this tutorial, we will use scikit-learn to explore different cross-validation techniques and their behavior.
