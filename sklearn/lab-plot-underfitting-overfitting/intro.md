# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the problems of underfitting and overfitting in machine learning, and how we can use linear regression with polynomial features to approximate nonlinear functions. We will use scikit-learn to generate data, fit models, and evaluate model performance.

> In this lab, You can write code in IPython or in `lab.ipynb`.
