# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use the successive halving search method to iteratively choose the best parameter combination out of multiple candidates. The `HalvingRandomSearchCV` class from the Scikit-learn library was used to implement the search method. The results of the search were analyzed and interpreted using a plot of the mean test scores over the iterations.
