  "title": "Comparing K-Means and MiniBatchKMeans",
  "description": "In this lab, we will compare two clustering algorithms: K-Means and MiniBatchKMeans. K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that is widely used in machine learning. MiniBatchKMeans is a variant of K-Means that is faster but gives slightly different results. We will cluster a set of data using both algorithms and plot the results. We will also plot the points that are labeled differently between the two algorithms.",
