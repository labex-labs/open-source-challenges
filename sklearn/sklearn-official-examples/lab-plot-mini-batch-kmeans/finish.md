# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to compare two clustering algorithms: K-Means and MiniBatchKMeans. We clustered a set of data using both algorithms and plotted the results. We also plotted the points that are labeled differently between the two algorithms. This comparison helps us to understand the differences between the two algorithms and choose the one that best suits our needs.
