# Introduction

Feature scaling is an important preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms. It involves rescaling each feature such that it has a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0. In this lab, we will explore the importance of feature scaling and its effect on machine learning models using the scikit-learn library in Python.

You can open the `plot-scaling-importance.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
