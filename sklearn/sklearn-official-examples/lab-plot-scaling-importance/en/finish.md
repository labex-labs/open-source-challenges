# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the importance of feature scaling in machine learning and its effect on model performance. We explored the effect of feature scaling on a K-nearest neighbors model and PCA dimensional reduction. We also trained a logistic regression model with PCA-reduced data to evaluate the effect of feature scaling on model performance. We found that scaling the features before reducing the dimensionality results in components with the same order of magnitude and improves the separability of the classes, leading to better model performance.
