# Import Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will use `matplotlib` for visualization, `datasets` and `metrics` from `sklearn` to load and evaluate the dataset, and `svm` for training the support vector machine.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets, svm, metrics
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```
