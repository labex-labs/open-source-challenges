# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare several classifiers in Scikit-Learn on synthetic datasets. The purpose of this lab is to illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. We will preprocess the datasets, split them into training and test parts, and plot the datasets. We will then iterate over classifiers, fit the classifiers on the training data, plot the decision boundaries, and plot the testing data. Finally, we will display the classification accuracy on the test set.
