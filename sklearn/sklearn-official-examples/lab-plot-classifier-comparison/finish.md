# Summary

In this lab, we compared several classifiers in Scikit-Learn on synthetic datasets. We preprocessed the datasets, split them into training and test parts, and plotted the datasets. We then iterated over classifiers, fit the classifiers on the training data, plotted the decision boundaries, and plotted the testing data. Finally, we displayed the classification accuracy on the test set.
