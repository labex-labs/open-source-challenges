# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify a sample using a custom kernel. We used scikit-learn library to perform SVM classification with a custom kernel. We loaded the iris dataset, created a custom kernel, created an instance of SVM classifier and fit our data, and plotted the decision boundary and the support vectors. SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.
