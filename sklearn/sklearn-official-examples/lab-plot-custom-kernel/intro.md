# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify a sample using a custom kernel. We will use Python's scikit-learn library to perform SVM classification with a custom kernel. SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and outlier detection. SVM works by creating a boundary or a line (hyperplane) that separates the data into classes.
