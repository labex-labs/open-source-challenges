# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn. We also compared the performance of these two dimensionality reduction algorithms and found that LDA performs better than PCA in separating the different classes in the dataset.
