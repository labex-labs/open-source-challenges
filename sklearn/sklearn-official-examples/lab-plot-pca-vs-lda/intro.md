# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the performance of two popular dimensionality reduction algorithms, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains 3 types of Iris flowers with 4 attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
