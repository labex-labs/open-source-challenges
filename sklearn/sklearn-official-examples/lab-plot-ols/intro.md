# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use linear regression to draw a straight line that best fits a dataset and how to calculate the coefficients, residual sum of squares, and coefficient of determination. We will be using the scikit-learn library to perform linear regression on the diabetes dataset.

You can open the `plot-ols.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
