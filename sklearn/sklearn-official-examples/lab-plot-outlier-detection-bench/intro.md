# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Scikit-Learn to perform outlier detection on classical anomaly detection datasets using the local outlier factor (LOF) and isolation forest (IForest) algorithms. The performance of the algorithms is assessed in an outlier detection context, and ROC curves are used to plot the results.
