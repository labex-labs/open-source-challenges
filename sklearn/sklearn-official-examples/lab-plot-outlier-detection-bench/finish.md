# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use Scikit-Learn to perform outlier detection on classical anomaly detection datasets using the local outlier factor (LOF) and isolation forest (IForest) algorithms. The performance of the algorithms was assessed in an outlier detection context, and ROC curves were used to plot the results.
