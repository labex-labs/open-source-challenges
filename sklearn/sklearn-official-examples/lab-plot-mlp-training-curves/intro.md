# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of using the Scikit-learn MLPClassifier to compare the performance of different stochastic learning strategies, including SGD and Adam. The MLPClassifier is a neural network classifier that uses backpropagation to optimize the weights of the network. The goal of this lab is to show how different stochastic learning strategies can affect the training loss curves of the MLPClassifier. We will use several small datasets for this example, although the general trend shown in these examples seems to carry over to larger datasets.
