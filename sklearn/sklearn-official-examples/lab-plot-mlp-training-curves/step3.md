# Define a function to plot the learning curves

Next, we need to define a function that will plot the learning curves for each learning strategy on each dataset. The function takes in the dataset (X, y), an axis to plot on, and a name for the dataset. We will use MinMaxScaler to scale the data and MLPClassifier to train the neural network. We will train the network using each learning strategy, ignoring convergence warnings, and plot the learning curves for each strategy on the same plot.

```python
def plot_on_dataset(X, y, ax, name):
    # for each dataset, plot learning for each learning strategy
    print("\nlearning on dataset %s" % name)
    ax.set_title(name)

    X = MinMaxScaler().fit_transform(X)
    mlps = []
    if name == "digits":
        # digits is larger but converges fairly quickly
        max_iter = 15
    else:
        max_iter = 400

    for label, param in zip(labels, params):
        print("training: %s" % label)
        mlp = MLPClassifier(random_state=0, max_iter=max_iter, **param)

        # some parameter combinations will not converge as can be seen on the
        # plots so they are ignored here
        with warnings.catch_warnings():
            warnings.filterwarnings(
                "ignore", category=ConvergenceWarning, module="sklearn"
            )
            mlp.fit(X, y)

        mlps.append(mlp)
        print("Training set score: %f" % mlp.score(X, y))
        print("Training set loss: %f" % mlp.loss_)
    for mlp, label, args in zip(mlps, labels, plot_args):
        ax.plot(mlp.loss_curve_, label=label, **args)
```
