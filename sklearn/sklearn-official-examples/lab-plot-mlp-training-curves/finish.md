# Summary

In this lab, we used the Scikit-learn MLPClassifier to compare the performance of different stochastic learning strategies, including SGD and Adam, on several small datasets. We defined different learning rate schedules and momentum parameters, and then trained the MLPClassifier using each strategy. We plotted the learning curves for each strategy on each dataset and observed how different strategies can affect the training loss curves. We demonstrated the importance of choosing the right learning strategy for the dataset and the task at hand.
