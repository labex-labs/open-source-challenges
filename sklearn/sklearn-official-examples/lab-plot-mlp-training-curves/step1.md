# Import necessary libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries, including MLPClassifier, MinMaxScaler, datasets, and matplotlib.pyplot. We will also import ConvergenceWarning to ignore convergence warnings during training.

```python
import warnings

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.exceptions import ConvergenceWarning
```
