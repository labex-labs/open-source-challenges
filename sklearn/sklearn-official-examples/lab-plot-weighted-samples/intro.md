# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to plot a decision function of a weighted dataset in SVM. We will create a model that takes into account sample weights and another model that does not take into account sample weights. We will then compare the two models by plotting their decision functions.

> You can write code in `plot-weighted-samples.ipynb`.
