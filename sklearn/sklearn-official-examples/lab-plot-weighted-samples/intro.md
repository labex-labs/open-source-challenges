# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to plot a decision function of a weighted dataset in SVM. We will create a model that takes into account sample weights and another model that does not take into account sample weights. We will then compare the two models by plotting their decision functions.

> You can open the `plot-weighted-samples.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
