# Introduction

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used for classification and regression analysis. SVMs find the best possible line or hyperplane that separates the data into different classes. The line or hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the two closest data points from different classes is called the margin. In this lab, we will explore how the parameter `C` affects the margin in a linear SVM.
