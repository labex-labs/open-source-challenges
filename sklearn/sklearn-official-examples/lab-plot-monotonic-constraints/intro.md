# Introduction

This is a step-by-step tutorial to demonstrate the effect of monotonic constraints on a gradient boosting estimator. Gradient boosting is a popular machine learning technique used for regression and classification tasks. In this tutorial, we will build an artificial dataset and use a gradient boosting estimator to demonstrate the effect of monotonic constraints on the model's predictions.

You can open the `plot-monotonic-constraints.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
