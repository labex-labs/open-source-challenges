# Summary

In this tutorial, we demonstrated the effect of monotonic constraints on a gradient boosting estimator. We generated an artificial dataset, fitted two models, one without any constraints and the other with monotonic constraints, and displayed the partial dependence of the predictions on the two features. We also demonstrated how to specify the monotonic constraints using feature names.
