# Generate Data

We will generate an artificial dataset where the target value is positively correlated with the first feature and negatively correlated with the second feature. We will also add some random noise to make the data more realistic.

```python
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)

n_samples = 1000
f_0 = rng.rand(n_samples)
f_1 = rng.rand(n_samples)
X = np.c_[f_0, f_1]
noise = rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.01, size=n_samples)

y = 5 * f_0 + np.sin(10 * np.pi * f_0) - 5 * f_1 - np.cos(10 * np.pi * f_1) + noise
```
