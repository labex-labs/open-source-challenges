# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use different scaling and transformation techniques on a dataset with outliers using Python's scikit-learn library. We learned how to select features, define feature mapping, and plot distributions. We also explored the effects of different scaling and transformation techniques and how they can affect the data.
