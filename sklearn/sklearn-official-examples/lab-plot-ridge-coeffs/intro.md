# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Ridge Regression for linear regression with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. We will use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library for Python.

> You can open the `plot-ridge-coeffs.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
