# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to implement different regularization strategies for Gradient Boosting using scikit-learn. Regularization is a technique that helps prevent overfitting, which is a common problem in machine learning models. We will use the binomial deviance loss function and the make_hastie_10_2 dataset for this lab.

> You can write code in `plot-gradient-boosting-regularization.ipynb`.
