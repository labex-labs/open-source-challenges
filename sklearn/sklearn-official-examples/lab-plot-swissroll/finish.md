# Summary

This lab compared the LLE and t-SNE embeddings of the classic Swiss Roll dataset and the Swiss-Hole dataset. We visualized the datasets and their embeddings using scatter plots. We observed that LLE was able to unroll the Swiss Roll and Swiss-Hole datasets effectively, while t-SNE preserved the general structure of the data but tended to clump sections of points together.
