# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of bias-variance decomposition and how it relates to single estimators versus bagging ensembles. We will use scikit-learn to generate and visualize toy regression problems and compare the expected mean squared error of a single estimator versus a bagging ensemble of decision trees.
