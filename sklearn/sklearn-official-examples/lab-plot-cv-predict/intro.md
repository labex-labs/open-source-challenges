# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use cross-validation to visualize model predictions and errors using the `cross_val_predict` and `PredictionErrorDisplay` functions in scikit-learn. We will load the diabetes dataset, create an instance of a linear regression model, and use cross-validation to obtain an array of predictions. We will then use `PredictionErrorDisplay` to plot the actual versus predicted values, as well as the residuals versus predicted values.
