# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use cross-validation to visualize model predictions and errors using the `cross_val_predict` and `PredictionErrorDisplay` functions in scikit-learn. We loaded the diabetes dataset, created an instance of a linear regression model, and used cross-validation to obtain an array of predictions. We then used `PredictionErrorDisplay` to plot the actual versus predicted values, as well as the residuals versus predicted values. Finally, we interpreted the results and discussed the importance of using per-fold performance metrics for model evaluation.
