# Import Libraries

In this step, we will import the necessary libraries, which are `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `gridspec`, and `BayesianGaussianMixture` from `sklearn.mixture`.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec
from sklearn.mixture import BayesianGaussianMixture
```
