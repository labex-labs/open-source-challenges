# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use the `BayesianGaussianMixture` class in scikit-learn to fit a toy dataset containing a mixture of three Gaussians. The class can adapt its number of mixture components automatically using a concentration prior, which is specified using the `weight_concentration_prior_type` parameter. This lab showed the difference between using a Dirichlet distribution prior and a Dirichlet process prior to select the number of components with non-zero weights.
