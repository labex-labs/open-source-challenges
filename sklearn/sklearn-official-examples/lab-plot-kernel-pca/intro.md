# Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving most of its original variation. However, PCA is a linear method and may not work well when the data has a non-linear structure. In such cases, Kernel PCA can be used instead of PCA. In this lab, we will demonstrate the differences between PCA and Kernel PCA and how to use them.
