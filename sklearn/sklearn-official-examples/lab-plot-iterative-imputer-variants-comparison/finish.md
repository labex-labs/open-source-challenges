# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Scikit-Learn's `IterativeImputer` class to impute missing values in a dataset. We compared different imputation strategies using mean and median imputation with `SimpleImputer` and different estimators with `IterativeImputer`. We found that `BayesianRidge` and `RandomForestRegressor` gave the best results for this particular pattern of missing values in the California housing dataset.
