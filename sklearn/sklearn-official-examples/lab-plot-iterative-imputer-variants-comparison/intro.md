# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Scikit-Learn's `IterativeImputer` class to impute missing values in a dataset. We will compare different estimators to see which one is best for the `IterativeImputer` when using a `BayesianRidge` estimator on the California housing dataset with a single value randomly removed from each row.

> You can write code in `plot-iterative-imputer-variants-comparison.ipynb`.
