# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Scikit-Learn's `IterativeImputer` class to impute missing values in a dataset. We will compare different estimators to see which one is best for the `IterativeImputer` when using a `BayesianRidge` estimator on the California housing dataset with a single value randomly removed from each row.

> You can open the `plot-iterative-imputer-variants-comparison.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
