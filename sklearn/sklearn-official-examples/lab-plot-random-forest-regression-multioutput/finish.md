# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use scikit-learn's `MultiOutputRegressor` to perform multi-output regression. We compared the performance of the multi-output regressor to a standard random forest regressor using a random dataset. The results showed that the multi-output regressor performed slightly better than the random forest regressor.
