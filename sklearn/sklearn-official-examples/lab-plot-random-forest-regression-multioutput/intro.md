# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the use of the multi-output meta estimator to perform multi-output regression. A random forest regressor is used, which supports multi-output regression natively, so the results can be compared. The purpose of this lab is to show how to use the `MultiOutputRegressor` in scikit-learn to perform multi-output regression, and compare the results to a standard random forest regressor.

> You can open the `plot-random-forest-regression-multioutput.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
