# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use regularization in multi-layer perceptron to combat overfitting. We compared different values of the regularization parameter, alpha, and observed how the decision functions changed. We also learned how to create synthetic datasets, standardize the data, create MLP classifiers, and plot decision boundaries.
