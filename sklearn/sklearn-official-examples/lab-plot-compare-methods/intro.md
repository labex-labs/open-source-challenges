# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare different Manifold Learning algorithms to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction. The purpose of this is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the original data's essential features.

We will be using the S-curve dataset, which is a commonly used dataset for dimensionality reduction. We will use algorithms like Locally Linear Embeddings, Isomap Embedding, Multidimensional Scaling, Spectral Embedding, and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding.
