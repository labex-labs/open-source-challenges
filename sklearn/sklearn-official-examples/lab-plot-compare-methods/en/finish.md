# Summary

Manifold Learning is an approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction. In this lab, we compared different Manifold Learning algorithms like Locally Linear Embeddings, Isomap Embedding, Multidimensional Scaling, Spectral Embedding, and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction on the S-curve dataset.
