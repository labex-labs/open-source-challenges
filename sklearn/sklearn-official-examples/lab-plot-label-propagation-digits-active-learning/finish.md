# Summary

In summary, this lab demonstrated an active learning technique using Label Propagation to learn handwritten digits. We started by training a label propagation model with only 10 labeled points, and iteratively selected the top five most uncertain points to label until we had 30 labeled data points. This active learning technique can be useful to minimize the number of labeled data points required to train a model while maximizing its performance.
