# Introduction

This lab demonstrates an active learning technique to learn handwritten digits using label propagation. The Label Propagation is a semi-supervised learning method that uses a graph-based approach to propagate labels across data points. Active learning is a process that allows us to iteratively select data points to label, and use these labeled points to retrain the model.
