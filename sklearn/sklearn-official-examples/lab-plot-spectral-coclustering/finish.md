# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to generate a dataset and bicluster it using the Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm. The original dataset was generated using the `make_biclusters` function, which created a matrix of small values and implanted biclusters with large values. We shuffled the rows and columns of the dataset and passed it to the Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm. We calculated the consensus score of the biclusters and rearranged the shuffled dataset to make the biclusters contiguous. Finally, we visualized the biclusters to show how accurately the algorithm found them.
