# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use the Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm to bicluster a dataset. The dataset is generated using the `make_biclusters` function, which creates a matrix of small values and implants biclusters with large values. The rows and columns are then shuffled and passed to the Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm. Rearranging the shuffled matrix to make biclusters contiguous shows how accurately the algorithm found the biclusters.
