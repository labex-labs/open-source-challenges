# Extract Noisy Patches and Reconstruct them using the Dictionary

In this step, we will extract noisy patches from the distorted image and reconstruct them using the dictionary. We will use four different transform algorithms, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, Least-angle Regression, and Thresholding, to reconstruct the patches. We will display the reconstructed image and compare it with the original image.
