# Introduction

In this lab, we will use scikit-learn to demonstrate how to compute the positive and negative likelihood ratios (`LR+`, `LR-`) to assess the predictive power of a binary classifier. These metrics are independent of the proportion between classes in the test set, which makes them very useful when the available data for a study has a different class proportion than the target application. We will go through the following steps:
