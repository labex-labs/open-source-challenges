# Introduction

In this lab, we will use scikit-learn to demonstrate how to compute the positive and negative likelihood ratios (`LR+`, `LR-`) to assess the predictive power of a binary classifier. These metrics are independent of the proportion between classes in the test set, which makes them very useful when the available data for a study has a different class proportion than the target application. We will go through the following steps:

You can open the `plot-likelihood-ratios.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
