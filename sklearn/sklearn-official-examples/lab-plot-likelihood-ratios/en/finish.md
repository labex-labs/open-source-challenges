# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to compute the positive and negative likelihood ratios to assess the predictive power of a binary classifier. These metrics are independent of the proportion between classes in the test set, making them very useful when the available data for a study has a different class proportion than the target application. We also learned how to assess the variability of the measurements for the class likelihood ratios in some particular cases using cross-validation and how to show that the class likelihood ratios are independent of the disease prevalence.
