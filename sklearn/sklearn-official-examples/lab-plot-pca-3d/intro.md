# Introduction

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to simplify data. It is a linear transformation technique that finds the most important features or patterns in the data. PCA is widely used in data analysis and machine learning for dimensionality reduction, data compression, and feature extraction. In this lab, we will use Python's scikit-learn library to perform PCA on a dataset and visualize the results.
