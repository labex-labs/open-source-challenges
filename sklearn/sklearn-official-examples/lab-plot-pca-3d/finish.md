# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform PCA on a dataset using Python's scikit-learn library. We generated a random dataset with three variables, performed PCA, and visualized the results. We plotted the data in a 3D scatter plot and added a plane for the first two principal components. PCA is a powerful technique for reducing the dimensionality of data and finding the most important patterns or features.
