# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated feature discretization on synthetic classification datasets using scikit-learn. We prepared the data, defined classifiers and parameters, implemented feature discretization, and visualized the results. This preprocessing technique can be useful in reducing the complexity of a dataset and improving the performance of linear classifiers. However, it should be used with caution and in conjunction with other techniques to avoid overfitting.
