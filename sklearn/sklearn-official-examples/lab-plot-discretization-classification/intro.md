# Introduction

In machine learning, feature discretization is a method of reducing the number of continuous variables in a dataset by creating bins or intervals to represent them. This method can be useful in cases where the number of continuous variables is large, and the algorithm needs to be simplified for easier analysis. In this lab, we will demonstrate feature discretization on synthetic classification datasets.
