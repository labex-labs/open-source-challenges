# Import the Required Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries, which include Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn datasets, NearestCentroid, and DecisionBoundaryDisplay.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestCentroid
from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay
```
