# Summary

In this lab, we learned about non-negative least squares regression and how it differs from classic linear regression. We used scikit-learn to implement this algorithm and compared it to classic linear regression by generating random data and splitting it into a train set and a test set. We then fit both models to the data, predicted the values for the test set, and calculated the R2 score. Finally, we compared the regression coefficients between the two models and observed that non-negative least squares regression yields sparse results.
