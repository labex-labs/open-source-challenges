# Summary

In this lab, we explored how model complexity influences both prediction accuracy and computational performance. We varied the model complexity through the choice of relevant model parameters in each of our selected models. We then measured the influence on both computational performance (latency) and predictive power (MSE or Hamming Loss). We concluded that a more complex model requires larger training time and does not guarantee to reduce the prediction error.
