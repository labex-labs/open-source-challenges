# Benchmark influence

We calculate the influence of the parameters on the given estimator. In each round, we set the estimator with the new value of the varying parameter and collect the prediction times, prediction performance, and complexities to see how those changes affect the estimator. We calculate the complexity using the complexity computer passed as a parameter.
