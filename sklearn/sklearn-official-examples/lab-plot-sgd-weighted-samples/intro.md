# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to plot a decision function of a weighted dataset using scikit-learn. We will also learn how to assign different weights to the samples in the dataset to show how the weights affect the decision function.

> You can open the `plot-sgd-weighted-samples.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
