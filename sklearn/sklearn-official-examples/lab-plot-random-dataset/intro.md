# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to plot several randomly generated classification datasets using Python's scikit-learn library. It visualizes all datasets using two features, plotted on the x and y axis. The color of each point represents its class label.

> You can open the `plot-random-dataset.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
