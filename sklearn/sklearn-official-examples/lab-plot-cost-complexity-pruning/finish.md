# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to use scikit-learn to perform cost complexity pruning for decision trees. We split the data into a training and testing set, determined the appropriate alpha values to use for pruning, trained decision trees using the effective alpha values, plotted the number of nodes and depth of the tree, and determined the best alpha value to use for pruning based on the accuracy of the training and testing sets.
