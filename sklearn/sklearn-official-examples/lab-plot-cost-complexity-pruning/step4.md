# Train the Decision Trees

Next, we will train a decision tree using each of the effective alpha values. The last value in `ccp_alphas` is the alpha value that prunes the whole tree, leaving the tree with only one node.

```python
clfs = []
for ccp_alpha in ccp_alphas:
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0, ccp_alpha=ccp_alpha)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    clfs.append(clf)
print(
    "Number of nodes in the last tree is: {} with ccp_alpha: {}".format(
        clfs[-1].tree_.node_count, ccp_alphas[-1]
    )
)
```
