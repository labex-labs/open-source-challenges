# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about the new features of scikit-learn 1.2, including pandas output with the set_output API, interaction constraints in histogram-based gradient boosting trees, and more. We also covered how to install scikit-learn 1.2 and demonstrated the use of several new and enhanced displays. Finally, we discussed the experimental support for the Array API specification in LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.
