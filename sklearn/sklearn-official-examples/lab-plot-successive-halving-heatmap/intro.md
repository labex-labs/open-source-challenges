# Introduction

This lab compares two popular parameter search algorithms in machine learning: Grid Search and Successive Halving. We will be using the scikit-learn library in Python to perform the comparison. These algorithms are used to find the best hyperparameters for a given machine learning model.

> You can open the `plot-successive-halving-heatmap.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
