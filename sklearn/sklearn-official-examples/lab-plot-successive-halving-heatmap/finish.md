# Summary

We have compared two popular parameter search algorithms in machine learning: Grid Search and Successive Halving. We used the scikit-learn library in Python to perform the comparison. We generated a synthetic dataset and performed parameter search on the SVC model using both algorithms. We then visualized the results using heatmaps. We saw that the Successive Halving algorithm was able to find parameter combinations that are just as accurate as Grid Search, in much less time.
