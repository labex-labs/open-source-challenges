# Summary

In this lab, we learned about K-Means++ initialization using the scikit-learn library in Python. We generated sample data, calculated seeds from k-means++, and plotted the init seeds alongside the sample data. K-Means++ is a popular algorithm for clustering data into groups based on similarities, and it is used as the default initialization for k-means.
