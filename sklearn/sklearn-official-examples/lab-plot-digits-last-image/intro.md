# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the scikit-learn digits dataset. This dataset consists of 1797 8x8 pixel images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0-9. Our goal is to analyze this dataset and understand how we can utilize it to classify handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms.

You can open the `plot-digits-last-image.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
