# Summary

In this lab, we explored the scikit-learn digits dataset and learned how to train a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits. We also learned how to evaluate the performance of the model and how to improve it by tuning the hyperparameters of the algorithm. This dataset is a great resource for anyone interested in learning about machine learning classification algorithms.
