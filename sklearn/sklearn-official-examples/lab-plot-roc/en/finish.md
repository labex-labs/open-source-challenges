# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to evaluate the performance of a multiclass classifier using the ROC curve and ROC AUC score. We demonstrated how to calculate ROC curves using the One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO) multiclass strategies. We also showed how to calculate micro and macro-averaged ROC curves and ROC AUC scores using Scikit-learn.
