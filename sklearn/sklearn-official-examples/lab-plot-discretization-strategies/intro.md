# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the different strategies available in the `KBinsDiscretizer` class of the Python scikit-learn library. `KBinsDiscretizer` is a class for discretizing continuous features into categorical features by binning the continuous data. We will visualize the different strategies by applying them to different datasets.

> You can open the `plot-discretization-strategies.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
