# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. We will be using the Scikit-Learn library in Python to perform this task. Feature selection is an important step in machine learning to improve model performance by removing irrelevant or redundant features.

You can open the `plot-rfe-digits.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
