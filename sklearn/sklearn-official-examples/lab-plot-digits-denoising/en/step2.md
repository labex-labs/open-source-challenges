# Create Training and Testing Sets

We split the dataset into a training set with 1000 samples and a testing set with 100 samples. We add Gaussian noise to the testing set and create two copies of the original data; one with noise and one without noise.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, stratify=y, random_state=0, train_size=1_000, test_size=100
)

rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
noise = rng.normal(scale=0.25, size=X_test.shape)
X_test_noisy = X_test + noise

noise = rng.normal(scale=0.25, size=X_train.shape)
X_train_noisy = X_train + noise
```
