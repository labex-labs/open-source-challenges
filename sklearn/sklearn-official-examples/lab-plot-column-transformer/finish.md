# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Scikit-Learn's `ColumnTransformer` on a dataset containing different types of features. We created transformers that extracted features from the dataset and used them to train a classifier on the combined set of features. The `ColumnTransformer` allowed us to process the different types of features in a single pipeline.
