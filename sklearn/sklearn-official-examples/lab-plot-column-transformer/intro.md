# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Scikit-Learn's `ColumnTransformer` on a dataset that contains different types of features. This technique is useful when a dataset contains components that require different feature extraction and processing pipelines.

You can open the `plot-column-transformer.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
