# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Scikit-Learn's `ColumnTransformer` on a dataset that contains different types of features. This technique is useful when a dataset contains components that require different feature extraction and processing pipelines.

> You can write code in `plot-column-transformer.ipynb`.
