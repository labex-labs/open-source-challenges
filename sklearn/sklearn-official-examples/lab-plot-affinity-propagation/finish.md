# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Affinity Propagation algorithm to perform clustering on a dataset. We generated a sample dataset, performed clustering using the Affinity Propagation algorithm, and plotted the resulting clusters. We also evaluated the quality of the clustering using various metrics.
