# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the Affinity Propagation algorithm to perform clustering on a dataset. The Affinity Propagation algorithm is a clustering algorithm that does not require the number of clusters to be predefined, and it is able to automatically determine the number of clusters based on the input data.

You can open the `plot-affinity-propagation.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
