# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the scikit-learn library in Python to estimate robust covariance matrices. The tutorial will introduce you to the concept of robust covariance estimation and demonstrate how it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of datasets that are contaminated with outliers.

You can open the `plot-robust-vs-empirical-covariance.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
