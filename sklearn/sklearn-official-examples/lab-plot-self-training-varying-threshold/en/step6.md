# Self-training with Varying Threshold

```python
for i, threshold in enumerate(x_values):
    self_training_clf = SelfTrainingClassifier(base_classifier, threshold=threshold)

    skfolds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits)
    for fold, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(skfolds.split(X, y)):
        X_train = X[train_index]
        y_train = y[train_index]
        X_test = X[test_index]
        y_test = y[test_index]
        y_test_true = y_true[test_index]

        self_training_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

        amount_labeled[i, fold] = (
            total_samples
            - np.unique(self_training_clf.labeled_iter_, return_counts=True)[1][0]
        )

        amount_iterations[i, fold] = np.max(self_training_clf.labeled_iter_)

        y_pred = self_training_clf.predict(X_test)
        scores[i, fold] = accuracy_score(y_test_true, y_pred)
```

We perform self-training with varying thresholds, using our base classifier and the `SelfTrainingClassifier` class from scikit-learn. We use stratified k-fold cross-validation to split our data into train and test sets. We then fit the self-training classifier on the training set, and calculate the accuracy of the classifier on the test set. We also store the amount of labeled samples and the iteration number for each fold.
