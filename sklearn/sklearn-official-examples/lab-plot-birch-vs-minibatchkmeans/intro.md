# Introduction

This lab compares the timing of two clustering algorithms, BIRCH and MiniBatchKMeans, on a synthetic dataset. Both algorithms are scalable and can efficiently cluster large datasets. The synthetic dataset has 25,000 samples and two features generated using make_blobs.

You can open the `plot-birch-vs-minibatchkmeans.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
