# Summary

This lab compared the timing of two clustering algorithms, BIRCH and MiniBatchKMeans, on a synthetic dataset. BIRCH is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that can efficiently cluster large datasets. MiniBatchKMeans is a variation of the KMeans algorithm that can also efficiently cluster large datasets. Both algorithms were able to cluster the dataset within a reasonable amount of time.
