  "title": "Hyperparameter Optimization: Randomized Search vs Grid Search",
  "description": "In machine learning, hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from data, but rather set prior to training. Selecting appropriate hyperparameters is crucial to achieving high accuracy in machine learning models. Two common methods for hyperparameter optimization are randomized search and grid search. In this lab, we will compare these two methods for optimizing hyperparameters of a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training.",
