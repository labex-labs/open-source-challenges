# Introduction

The decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. It is a tree-based model that partitions the feature space into a set of non-overlapping regions and predicts the target value for each region. In this lab, we will learn how to analyse the decision tree structure to gain further insight into the relation between the features and the target to predict.

You can open the `plot-unveil-tree-structure.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
