# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to analyse the decision tree structure to gain further insight into the relation between the features and the target to predict. We have seen how to retrieve the binary tree structure, visualize the decision tree, and retrieve the decision path and leaf nodes for a sample or a group of samples. These techniques can help us better understand how the decision tree classifier makes its predictions and can guide us in fine-tuning the model to improve its performance.
