# Analyze the Binary Tree Structure

The decision tree classifier has an attribute called `tree_` which allows access to low level attributes such as `node_count`, the total number of nodes, and `max_depth`, the maximal depth of the tree. It also stores the entire binary tree structure, represented as a number of parallel arrays. Using these arrays, we can traverse the tree structure to compute various properties such as the depth of each node and whether or not it is a leaf. Below is the code to compute these properties:

```python
import numpy as np

n_nodes = clf.tree_.node_count
children_left = clf.tree_.children_left
children_right = clf.tree_.children_right
feature = clf.tree_.feature
threshold = clf.tree_.threshold

node_depth = np.zeros(shape=n_nodes, dtype=np.int64)
is_leaves = np.zeros(shape=n_nodes, dtype=bool)
stack = [(0, 0)]  # start with the root node id (0) and its depth (0)
while len(stack) > 0:
    # `pop` ensures each node is only visited once
    node_id, depth = stack.pop()
    node_depth[node_id] = depth

    # If the left and right child of a node is not the same we have a split
    # node
    is_split_node = children_left[node_id] != children_right[node_id]
    # If a split node, append left and right children and depth to `stack`
    # so we can loop through them
    if is_split_node:
        stack.append((children_left[node_id], depth + 1))
        stack.append((children_right[node_id], depth + 1))
    else:
        is_leaves[node_id] = True

print(
    "The binary tree structure has {n} nodes and has "
    "the following tree structure:\n".format(n=n_nodes)
)
for i in range(n_nodes):
    if is_leaves[i]:
        print(
            "{space}node={node} is a leaf node.".format(
                space=node_depth[i] * "\t", node=i
            )
        )
    else:
        print(
            "{space}node={node} is a split node: "
            "go to node {left} if X[:, {feature}] <= {threshold} "
            "else to node {right}.".format(
                space=node_depth[i] * "\t",
                node=i,
                left=children_left[i],
                feature=feature[i],
                threshold=threshold[i],
                right=children_right[i],
            )
        )
```
