# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use polynomial kernel approximation in scikit-learn to efficiently generate polynomial kernel feature-space approximations. We applied this technique to the Covtype dataset, transforming it into a binary classification problem and training linear classifiers that approximate the accuracy of kernelized ones. We also compared the performance of the different methods and plotted the results against their training times.
