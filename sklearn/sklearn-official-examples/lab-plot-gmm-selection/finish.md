# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform model selection with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) using information-theory criteria. We used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) to select the best model. We generated two components by randomly sampling the standard normal distribution. One component was kept spherical yet shifted and re-scaled. The other one was deformed to have a more general covariance matrix. We visualized the different components, trained and selected the best model, plotted the BIC scores, and plotted the best model.
