# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to perform model selection with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) using information-theory criteria. Model selection concerns both the covariance type and the number of components in the model. We will use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) to select the best model. We will generate two components by randomly sampling the standard normal distribution. One component is kept spherical yet shifted and re-scaled. The other one is deformed to have a more general covariance matrix.
