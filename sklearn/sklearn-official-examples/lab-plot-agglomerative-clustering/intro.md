# Introduction

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together. It starts with each data point as a separate cluster and then combines these clusters iteratively based on their similarity until all data points belong to a single cluster. In this lab, we will explore the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local structure in the data.

You can open the `plot-agglomerative-clustering.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
