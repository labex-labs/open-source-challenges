# Summary

In this lab, we explored the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local structure in the data using Agglomerative Clustering. We visualized the clustering with and without connectivity and observed that using a connectivity graph can lead to more stable and meaningful clusters. We also observed that a larger number of neighbors leads to more homogeneous clusters at the cost of computation time.
