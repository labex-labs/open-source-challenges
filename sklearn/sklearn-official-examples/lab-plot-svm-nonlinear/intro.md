# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of performing binary classification using non-linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The target to predict is an XOR of the inputs. The color map illustrates the decision function learned by the SVM. We will use Python scikit-learn library for this task.

> You can open the `plot-svm-nonlinear.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
