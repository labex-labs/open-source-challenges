# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Python scikit-learn library to explore the difference between Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge Regression. We saw how these two methods of linear regression cope with noise in the data, and how they differ in their predictions. We also visualized the results of our analysis.
