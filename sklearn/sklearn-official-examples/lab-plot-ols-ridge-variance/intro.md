# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Python scikit-learn library to explore the difference between Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge Regression. We will examine how these two methods of linear regression cope with noise in the data, and how they differ in their predictions.

You can open the `plot-ols-ridge-variance.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
