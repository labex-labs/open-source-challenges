# Summary

In this tutorial, we covered several new features and improvements in scikit-learn 1.1. These include quantile loss in `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`, `get_feature_names_out` available in all transformers, grouping infrequent categories in `OneHotEncoder`, performance improvements, `MiniBatchNMF`, and `BisectingKMeans`. These features and improvements make scikit-learn an even more powerful and flexible library for machine learning in Python.
