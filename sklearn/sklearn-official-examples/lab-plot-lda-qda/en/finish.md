# Summary

In this lab, we learned about Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA). We generated two datasets and used LDA and QDA to find the linear and quadratic decision boundaries, respectively. We visualized the decision boundaries and the covariance ellipsoids for each algorithm.
