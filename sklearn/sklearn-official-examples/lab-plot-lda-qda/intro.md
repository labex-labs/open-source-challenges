# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA). LDA and QDA are classification algorithms that are used to find a linear and quadratic decision boundary, respectively, between two or more classes. We will use the scikit-learn library to implement these algorithms and visualize the decision boundaries.
