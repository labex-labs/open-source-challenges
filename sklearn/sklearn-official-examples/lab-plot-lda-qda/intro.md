# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA). LDA and QDA are classification algorithms that are used to find a linear and quadratic decision boundary, respectively, between two or more classes. We will use the scikit-learn library to implement these algorithms and visualize the decision boundaries.

> You can open the `plot-lda-qda.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
