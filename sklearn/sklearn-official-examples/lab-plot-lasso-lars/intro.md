# Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to compute the Lasso Path along the regularization parameter using the LARS algorithm on the diabetes dataset. The Lasso Path is a plot of the coefficients of a linear model as the L1 regularization parameter is increased. Each color represents a different feature of the coefficient vector, and this is displayed as a function of the regularization parameter.

You can open the `plot-lasso-lars.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
