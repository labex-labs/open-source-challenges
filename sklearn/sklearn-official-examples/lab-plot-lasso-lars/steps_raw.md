# Scikit-Learn Lasso Path

## Introduction

This lab will demonstrate how to compute the Lasso Path along the regularization parameter using the LARS algorithm on the diabetes dataset. The Lasso Path is a plot of the coefficients of a linear model as the L1 regularization parameter is increased. Each color represents a different feature of the coefficient vector, and this is displayed as a function of the regularization parameter.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Data

The first step is to load the diabetes dataset from Scikit-Learn.

```python
from sklearn import datasets

X, y = datasets.load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)
```

### Step 2: Compute Lasso Path

Next, we compute the Lasso Path using the LARS algorithm. The `lars_path` function from Scikit-Learn's `linear_model` module is used to compute the Lasso Path. The function takes the input features, target variable, and method as parameters. In this case, we use the "lasso" method for L1 regularization.

```python
from sklearn import linear_model

_, _, coefs = linear_model.lars_path(X, y, method="lasso", verbose=True)
```

### Step 3: Plot Lasso Path

After computing the Lasso Path, we plot the results. The coefficients for each feature are plotted as a function of the regularization parameter.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

xx = np.sum(np.abs(coefs.T), axis=1)
xx /= xx[-1]

plt.plot(xx, coefs.T)
ymin, ymax = plt.ylim()
plt.vlines(xx, ymin, ymax, linestyle="dashed")
plt.xlabel("|coef| / max|coef|")
plt.ylabel("Coefficients")
plt.title("LASSO Path")
plt.axis("tight")
plt.show()
```

### Step 4: Interpret Results

The resulting plot shows the Lasso Path for the diabetes dataset. Each color represents a different feature of the coefficient vector, and this is displayed as a function of the regularization parameter. As the regularization parameter increases, the coefficients for some features shrink towards zero, indicating that those features are less important for predicting the target variable.

## Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to compute and plot the Lasso Path using the LARS algorithm on the diabetes dataset. The Lasso Path is a useful visualization for understanding the effect of L1 regularization on the coefficients of a linear model.
