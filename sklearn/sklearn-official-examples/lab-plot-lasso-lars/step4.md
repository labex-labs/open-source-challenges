# Interpret Results

The resulting plot shows the Lasso Path for the diabetes dataset. Each color represents a different feature of the coefficient vector, and this is displayed as a function of the regularization parameter. As the regularization parameter increases, the coefficients for some features shrink towards zero, indicating that those features are less important for predicting the target variable.
