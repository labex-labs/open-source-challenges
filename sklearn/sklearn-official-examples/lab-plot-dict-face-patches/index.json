  "description": "This lab demonstrates how to use the scikit-learn API to process a large dataset of faces and learn a set of 20 x 20 image patches that represent faces. The key aspect of this lab is the use of online learning, where we load and process images one at a time and extract 50 random patches from each image. We accumulate 500 patches (from 10 images) and then run the online KMeans object, MiniBatchKMeans' partial_fit method.",
