# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use different cross decomposition algorithms such as PLS Canonical, PLS Regression, and CCA to extract directions of covariance from multivariate datasets.

> You can open the `plot-compare-cross-decomposition.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
