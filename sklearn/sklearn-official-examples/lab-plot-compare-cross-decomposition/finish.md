# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use different cross decomposition algorithms to extract directions of covariance from multivariate datasets. We created a dataset, transformed the data using PLS Canonical, PLS Regression, and CCA, and estimated the values of matrices and betas. We also created scatter plots to visualize the scores of components.
