# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the calibration of four different models: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Linear SVM. Calibration curves will be plotted for each model, which show the relationship between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. This is important because well-calibrated models produce probabilities that are accurate and reliable.
