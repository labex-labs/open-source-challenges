# Conclusion

In this lab, we compared the calibration of four different models: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Linear SVM. We plotted calibration curves for each model and observed that well-calibrated models produce curves that follow the diagonal line. The four models produced different results, with Logistic Regression being well calibrated and the other models showing varying degrees of bias. Calibration is an important aspect of machine learning models, and well-calibrated models produce probabilities that are accurate and reliable.
