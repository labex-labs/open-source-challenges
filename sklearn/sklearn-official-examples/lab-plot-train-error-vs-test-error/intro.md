# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Scikit-learn Elastic-Net regression model to illustrate how the performance of an estimator on unseen data (test data) is not the same as the performance on training data. We will generate sample data, compute train and test errors, and plot the results functions.

You can open the `plot-train-error-vs-test-error.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
