# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Scikit-learn Elastic-Net regression model to compute train and test errors and plot the results functions. We also learned how the performance of an estimator on unseen data (test data) is not the same as the performance on training data. We generated sample data, computed train and test errors, and plotted the results functions using the `make_regression()`, `linear_model.ElasticNet()`, `train_test_split()`, `np.logspace()`, and `matplotlib` functions.
