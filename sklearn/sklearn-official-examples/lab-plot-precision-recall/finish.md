# Summary

This tutorial provided a step-by-step guide on how to use the Precision-Recall metric to evaluate classifier output quality. We learned how to plot the Precision-Recall curve for binary classification using the PrecisionRecallDisplay class from the sklearn.metrics library. We also learned how to plot the Precision-Recall curve for multi-label classification using OneVsRestClassifier and how to calculate precision and recall for each class.
