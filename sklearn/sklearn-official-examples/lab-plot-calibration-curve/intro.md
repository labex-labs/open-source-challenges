# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use calibration curves to evaluate the predicted probabilities of a classification model. We will use scikit-learn to perform the classification and visualize the results.

You can open the `plot-calibration-curve.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
