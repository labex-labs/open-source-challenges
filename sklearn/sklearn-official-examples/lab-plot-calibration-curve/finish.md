# Summary

We learned how to use calibration curves to evaluate the predicted probabilities of a classification model. We compared several classifiers with calibration curves and evaluated them with several classification metrics. We also learned that parametric sigmoid calibration can deal with situations where the calibration curve of the base classifier is sigmoid, but not where it is transposed-sigmoid. Non-parametric isotonic calibration can deal with both situations but may require more data to produce good results.
