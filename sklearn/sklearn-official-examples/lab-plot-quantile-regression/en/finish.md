# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to perform quantile regression using scikit-learn. We generated two synthetic datasets to illustrate how quantile regression can predict non-trivial conditional quantiles. We used the `QuantileRegressor` class to estimate the median as well as a low and high quantile fixed at 5% and 95%, respectively. We compared `QuantileRegressor` with `LinearRegression` and evaluated their performance using mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE).
