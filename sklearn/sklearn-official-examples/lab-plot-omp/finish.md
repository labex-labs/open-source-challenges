# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to use Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to recover a sparse signal from a noisy measurement encoded with a dictionary. We have used scikit-learn to implement OMP and generate a sparse coded signal. We have also plotted the sparse signal, the noise-free reconstruction, the noisy reconstruction, and the noisy reconstruction with the number of non-zeros set by CV.
