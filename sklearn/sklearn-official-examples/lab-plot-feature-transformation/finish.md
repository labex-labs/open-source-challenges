# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to transform features into a higher dimensional, sparse space using an ensemble of trees. We used different types of ensemble methods including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and compared their performance. The `RandomTreesEmbedding` is an unsupervised method and does not require to be trained independently. We also learned how to pipeline random forest or gradient boosting with a logistic regression using the `FunctionTransformer`. Finally, we evaluated the performance of all the models using ROC curves.
