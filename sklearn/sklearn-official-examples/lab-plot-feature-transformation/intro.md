# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to transform features into a higher dimensional, sparse space using an ensemble of trees. We will then train a linear model on these features. We will use different types of ensemble methods including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting and compare their performance.

You can open the `plot-feature-transformation.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
