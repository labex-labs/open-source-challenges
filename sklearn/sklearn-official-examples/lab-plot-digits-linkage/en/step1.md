# Import Libraries

We start by importing the necessary libraries for this lab. We will be using numpy, matplotlib, manifold, and datasets from scikit-learn to perform agglomerative clustering.

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from time import time
from sklearn import manifold, datasets
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
```
