# Introduction

This lab illustrates various linkage options for agglomerative clustering on a 2D embedding of the digits dataset. The goal of this lab is to show how different linkage strategies behave and not to find good clusters for the digits. This is why the example works on a 2D embedding.

> You can open the `plot-digits-linkage.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
