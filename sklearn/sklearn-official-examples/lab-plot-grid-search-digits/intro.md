# Introduction

This lab shows how to perform hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation using the scikit-learn library. The aim is to classify handwritten digits images using a binary classification for easier understanding: identifying whether a digit is 8 or not. The dataset used is the digits dataset. The performance of the selected hyper-parameters and trained model is then measured on a dedicated evaluation set that was not used during the model selection step.
