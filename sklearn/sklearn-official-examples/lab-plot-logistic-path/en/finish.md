# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to train L1-penalized logistic regression models on the Iris dataset and plot their regularization paths. The regularization path shows how the coefficients of the model change with different regularization strengths. This method is useful in feature selection, as it can identify which features have the most significant impact on the model.
