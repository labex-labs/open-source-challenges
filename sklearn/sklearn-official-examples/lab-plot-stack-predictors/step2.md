# Make pipeline to preprocess the data

Before we can use the Ames dataset we still need to do some preprocessing. First, we will select the categorical and numerical columns of the dataset to construct the first step of the pipeline. Then, we will need to design preprocessing pipelines which depend on the ending regressor. If the ending regressor is a linear model, one needs to one-hot encode the categories. If the ending regressor is a tree-based model an ordinal encoder will be sufficient. Besides, numerical values need to be standardized for a linear model while the raw numerical data can be treated as is by a tree-based model. However, both models need an imputer to handle missing values.
