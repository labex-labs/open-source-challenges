# Download the dataset

We will use the Ames Housing dataset which was first compiled by Dean De Cock and became better known after it was used in Kaggle challenge. It is a set of 1460 residential homes in Ames, Iowa, each described by 80 features. We will use it to predict the final logarithmic price of the houses. In this example we will use only 20 most interesting features chosen using GradientBoostingRegressor() and limit number of entries.
