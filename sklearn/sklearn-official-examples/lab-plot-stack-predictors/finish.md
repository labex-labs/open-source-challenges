# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Stacking method to blend several estimators to make predictions. We used the Ames Housing dataset to predict the final logarithmic price of the houses. We also learned how to design preprocessing pipelines which depend on the ending regressor and how to measure the performance of each individual predictor as well as of the stack of the regressors.
