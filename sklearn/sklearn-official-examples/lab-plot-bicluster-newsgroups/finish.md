# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform biclustering using the Spectral Co-clustering algorithm on the twenty newsgroups dataset. We also learned how to cluster the data using MiniBatchKMeans for comparison. Finally, we found the best biclusters by calculating their normalized cut and selecting the top five.
