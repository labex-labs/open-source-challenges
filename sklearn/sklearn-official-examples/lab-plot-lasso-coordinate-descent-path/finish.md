# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about Lasso and Elastic Net, which are techniques used for linear regression. We learned how to compute regularization paths using the Lasso and Elastic Net, and how to display the results using matplotlib. We also learned how to compute the regularization path using positive Lasso and positive Elastic Net techniques.
