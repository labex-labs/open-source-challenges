# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about Lasso and Elastic Net, which are techniques used for linear regression and implemented using a coordinate descent. We will learn how to compute regularization paths using the Lasso and Elastic Net, and how to display the results using matplotlib.

> You can write code in `plot-lasso-coordinate-descent-path.ipynb`.
