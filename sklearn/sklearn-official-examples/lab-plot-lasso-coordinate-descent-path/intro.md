# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about Lasso and Elastic Net, which are techniques used for linear regression and implemented using a coordinate descent. We will learn how to compute regularization paths using the Lasso and Elastic Net, and how to display the results using matplotlib.

You can open the `plot-lasso-coordinate-descent-path.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
