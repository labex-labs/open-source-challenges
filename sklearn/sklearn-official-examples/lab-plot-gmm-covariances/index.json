  "description": "This tutorial demonstrates the use of different covariance types for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). GMMs are often used for clustering, and we can compare the obtained clusters with the actual classes from the dataset. We initialize the means of the Gaussians with the means of the classes from the training set to make this comparison valid. We plot predicted labels on both training and held-out test data using a variety of GMM covariance types on the iris dataset. We compare GMMs with spherical, diagonal, full, and tied covariance matrices in increasing order of performance.",
