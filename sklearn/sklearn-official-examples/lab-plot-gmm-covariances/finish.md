# Summary

This tutorial demonstrated the use of different covariance types for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in Python. We used the Iris dataset as an example and compared GMMs with spherical, diagonal, full, and tied covariance matrices in increasing order of performance. We plotted predicted labels on both training and held-out test data and showed that full covariance is prone to overfitting on small datasets and does not generalize well to held-out test data.
