# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the reconstruction of a sparse image from a set of parallel projections using compressive sensing. Compressive sensing is a technique for efficiently acquiring and reconstructing signals that are sparse in some domain. In this case, we are interested in reconstructing a 2D image from a small number of projections acquired along different angles. We will compare the performance of L1 and L2 penalization methods for this task.
