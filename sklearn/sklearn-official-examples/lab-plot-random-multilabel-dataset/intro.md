# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to generate a multilabel dataset using the `make_multilabel_classification` function of Scikit-Learn library. The function generates random samples of multilabel data, where each sample has counts of two features, which are differently distributed in each of two classes.

> You can open the `plot-random-multilabel-dataset.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
