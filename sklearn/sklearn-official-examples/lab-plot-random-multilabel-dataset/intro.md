# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to generate a multilabel dataset using the `make_multilabel_classification` function of Scikit-Learn library. The function generates random samples of multilabel data, where each sample has counts of two features, which are differently distributed in each of two classes.

> You can write code in `plot-random-multilabel-dataset.ipynb`.
