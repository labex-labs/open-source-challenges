In this lab, we will learn how to use approximate nearest neighbors in TSNE using Python's scikit-learn library.

> You can open the `approximate-nearest-neighbors.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
