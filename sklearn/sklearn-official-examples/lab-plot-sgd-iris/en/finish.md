# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Scikit-Learn's SGDClassifier to implement a multi-class classification model on the iris dataset. We visualized the decision surface of the trained model on the dataset and plotted the hyperplanes corresponding to the three one-versus-all (OVA) classifiers.
