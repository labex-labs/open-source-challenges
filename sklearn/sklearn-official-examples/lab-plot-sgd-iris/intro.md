# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Scikit-Learn's SGDClassifier to implement a multi-class classification model on the famous iris dataset. We will plot the decision surface of the model on the dataset and visualize the hyperplanes corresponding to the three one-versus-all (OVA) classifiers.

> You can open the `plot-sgd-iris.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
