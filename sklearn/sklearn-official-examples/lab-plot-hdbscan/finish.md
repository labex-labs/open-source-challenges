# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm and its advantages over the DBSCAN algorithm. We saw that HDBSCAN is scale-invariant, capable of multi-scale clustering, and relatively robust to various real-world examples thanks to the `min_cluster_size` and `min_samples` parameters.
