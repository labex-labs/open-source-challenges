# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, which is an improvement over the DBSCAN algorithm. We will compare both algorithms on specific datasets and evaluate HDBSCAN's sensitivity to certain hyperparameters.

You can open the `plot-hdbscan.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
