# Summary

We have successfully performed blind source separation on a mixed signal using FastICA and PCA. We generated a sample mixed signal consisting of three independent components, added noise, and standardized the data. We then generated a mixing matrix to mix our independent components. We used FastICA to estimate the independent sources and computed PCA for comparison. Finally, we plotted the original mixed signal, the original independent sources, the sources estimated by ICA, and the sources estimated by PCA.
