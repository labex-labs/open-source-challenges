# Introduction

The scikit-learn library provides tools for text feature extraction and evaluation. In this lab, we will use the 20newsgroups dataset to demonstrate how to extract features from text data, build a pipeline, and evaluate the performance of the model using hyperparameter tuning.

> You can write code in `plot-grid-search-text-feature-extraction.ipynb`.
