# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to extract features from text data, build a pipeline, and evaluate the performance of the model using hyperparameter tuning. We used the 20newsgroups dataset to show how to use RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the pipeline and visualize the results using plotly.express.
