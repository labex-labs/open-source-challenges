# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the differences between univariate F-test statistics and mutual information. We will use scikit-learn library to perform F-test and mutual information regression on a dataset and compare the results.

You can open the `plot-f-test-vs-mi.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
