# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use classification techniques on the Digits dataset using scikit-learn. We loaded the dataset, preprocessed the data, split the dataset into training and testing sets, and then trained and tested two different classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression) on the testing set. Finally, we compared the accuracy of both classifiers.
