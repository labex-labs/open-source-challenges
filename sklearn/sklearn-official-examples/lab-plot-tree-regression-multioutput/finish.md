# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use decision trees for multi-output regression. We created a random dataset, fit regression models, made predictions, and plotted the results. The decision trees learned local linear regressions approximating the circle. We also saw that if the maximum depth of the tree is set too high, the decision trees learn too fine details of the training data and learn from the noise, i.e. they overfit.
