# Introduction

This lab will walk you through an example of multi-output regression with decision tree. You will see how decision trees are used to predict simultaneously the noisy x and y observations of a circle given a single underlying feature. As a result, it learns local linear regressions approximating the circle.

> You can write code in `plot-tree-regression-multioutput.ipynb`.
