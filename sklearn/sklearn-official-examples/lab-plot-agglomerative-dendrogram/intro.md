# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to plot the corresponding dendrogram of a hierarchical clustering using AgglomerativeClustering and the dendrogram method available in scipy.

> You can open the `plot-agglomerative-dendrogram.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
