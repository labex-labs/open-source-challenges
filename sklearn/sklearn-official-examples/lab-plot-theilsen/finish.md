# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about Theil-Sen Regression and its implementation using Python scikit-learn library. We also saw how it differs from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Robust Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) regression. By following the above steps, we were able to generate a synthetic dataset, fit linear regression models, and plot the regression lines.
