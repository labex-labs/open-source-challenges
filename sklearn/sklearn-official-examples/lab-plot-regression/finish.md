# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to use the Nearest Neighbors Regression algorithm to predict the values of new data points based on the k-nearest neighbors in the training set. We used scikit-learn to generate sample data and fit our regression model using both uniform and distance weights. We then plotted the data points and predicted values to visualize the accuracy of our model.
