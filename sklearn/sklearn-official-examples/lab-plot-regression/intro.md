# Introduction

Nearest Neighbors Regression is a machine learning algorithm that predicts the value of a new data point by finding the k-nearest data points in the training set and using their average value to predict the new value. In this lab, we will use scikit-learn to demonstrate how to resolve a regression problem using a k-Nearest Neighbor and the interpolation of the target using both barycenter and constant weights.
