# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Ridge Regression for estimating collinear coefficients of an estimator. Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that applies L2 regularization to the model.

In this example, we will generate a 10x10 Hilbert matrix and use Ridge Regression to estimate the coefficients of the matrix.
