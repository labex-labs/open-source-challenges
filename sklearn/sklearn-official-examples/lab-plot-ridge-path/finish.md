# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to use Ridge Regression for estimating collinear coefficients of an estimator. We generated a 10x10 Hilbert matrix and used Ridge Regression to estimate the coefficients of the matrix. We then visualized the results of the Ridge Regression paths. Ridge Regression is useful for reducing the variation (noise) in highly ill-conditioned matrices. By setting a certain regularization strength, we can balance the effect of the regularization and the squared loss function.
