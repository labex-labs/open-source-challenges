# Scikit-learn Ridge Regression Example

## Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Ridge Regression for estimating collinear coefficients of an estimator. Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that applies L2 regularization to the model.

In this example, we will generate a 10x10 Hilbert matrix and use Ridge Regression to estimate the coefficients of the matrix.

## Steps

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

In this step, we will import the required libraries for this example.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import linear_model
```

### Step 2: Generate Data

In this step, we will generate a 10x10 Hilbert matrix and set the target variable y to be a vector of ones.

```python
X = 1.0 / (np.arange(1, 11) + np.arange(0, 10)[:, np.newaxis])
y = np.ones(10)
```

### Step 3: Compute Ridge Regression Paths

In this step, we will compute the Ridge Regression paths for different regularization strengths.

```python
n_alphas = 200
alphas = np.logspace(-10, -2, n_alphas)

coefs = []
for a in alphas:
    ridge = linear_model.Ridge(alpha=a, fit_intercept=False)
    ridge.fit(X, y)
    coefs.append(ridge.coef_)
```

### Step 4: Visualize Results

In this step, we will visualize the results of the Ridge Regression paths.

```python
ax = plt.gca()

ax.plot(alphas, coefs)
ax.set_xscale("log")
ax.set_xlim(ax.get_xlim()[::-1])  # reverse axis
plt.xlabel("alpha")
plt.ylabel("weights")
plt.title("Ridge coefficients as a function of the regularization")
plt.axis("tight")
plt.show()
```

## Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to use Ridge Regression for estimating collinear coefficients of an estimator. We generated a 10x10 Hilbert matrix and used Ridge Regression to estimate the coefficients of the matrix. We then visualized the results of the Ridge Regression paths. Ridge Regression is useful for reducing the variation (noise) in highly ill-conditioned matrices. By setting a certain regularization strength, we can balance the effect of the regularization and the squared loss function.
