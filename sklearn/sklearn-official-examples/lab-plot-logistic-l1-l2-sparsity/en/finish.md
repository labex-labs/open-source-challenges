# Summary

In this lab, we explored the sparsity of solutions when L1, L2, and Elastic-Net penalty are used for different values of C. We used logistic regression to classify 8x8 images of digits into two classes: 0-4 against 5-9. We visualized the coefficients of the models for varying C. We also calculated the sparsity and scores for each model and printed the results.
