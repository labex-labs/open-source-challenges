# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to balance model complexity and cross-validated score using PCA and LinearSVC. We used GridSearchCV to find the best number of PCA components while maximizing the accuracy score within 1 standard deviation of the best score. We also visualized the results to better understand the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy.
