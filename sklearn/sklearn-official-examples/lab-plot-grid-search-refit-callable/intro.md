# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to balance model complexity and cross-validated score by finding a decent accuracy within 1 standard deviation of the best accuracy score while minimizing the number of PCA components. We will use the digits dataset from scikit-learn and a pipeline consisting of PCA and LinearSVC.
