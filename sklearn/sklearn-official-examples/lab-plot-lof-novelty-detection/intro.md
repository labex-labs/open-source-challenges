# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to perform novelty detection. LOF is an unsupervised anomaly detection method that identifies the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. It considers the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors as outliers.

You can open the `plot-lof-novelty-detection.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
