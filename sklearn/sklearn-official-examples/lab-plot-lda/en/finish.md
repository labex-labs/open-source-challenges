# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to implement Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) using scikit-learn. We explored how the Ledoit-Wolf and Oracle Shrinkage Approximating (OAS) estimators of covariance can improve classification accuracy. We also generated random data with a discriminative feature and tested our classifiers on this data. Finally, we visualized the classification accuracy as a function of the number of features.
