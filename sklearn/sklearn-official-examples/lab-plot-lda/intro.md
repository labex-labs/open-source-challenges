# Introduction

This lab will introduce you to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and how it can be used for classification. We will use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, to implement LDA. We will also explore how the Ledoit-Wolf and Oracle Shrinkage Approximating (OAS) estimators of covariance can improve classification.

You can open the `plot-lda.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
