# Introduction

This lab will introduce you to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and how it can be used for classification. We will use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, to implement LDA. We will also explore how the Ledoit-Wolf and Oracle Shrinkage Approximating (OAS) estimators of covariance can improve classification.

> You can write code in `plot-lda.ipynb`.
