# Interpretation of the Results

The plot shows the mean test scores of the candidates over the iterations. At the first iteration, all candidates are evaluated with a small amount of resources. At the second iteration, only the best half of the candidates is evaluated with double the amount of resources. This process is repeated until the last iteration, where only 2 candidates are left. The best candidate is the one with the highest mean test score at the last iteration.
