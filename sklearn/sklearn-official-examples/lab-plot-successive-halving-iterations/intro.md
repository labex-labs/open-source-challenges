# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use the successive halving search method to iteratively choose the best parameter combination out of multiple candidates. This method is implemented in `HalvingGridSearchCV` and `HalvingRandomSearchCV` classes from the Scikit-learn library. The `HalvingRandomSearchCV` class will be used in this lab.

You can open the `plot-successive-halving-iterations.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
