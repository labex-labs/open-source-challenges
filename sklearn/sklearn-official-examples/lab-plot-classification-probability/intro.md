# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to plot the classification probability of different classifiers using Python Scikit-learn. We will use a 3 class dataset, and we classify it with a Support Vector classifier, L1 and L2 penalized logistic regression with either a One-Vs-Rest or multinomial setting, and Gaussian process classification.
