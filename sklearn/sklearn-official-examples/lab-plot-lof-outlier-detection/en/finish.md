# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to use Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for outlier detection. We have generated a dataset with outliers, fit the model for outlier detection, and plotted the results. LOF is a powerful unsupervised machine learning method that can be used to detect anomalies in a wide range of applications.
