# Import Libraries

We will import `numpy` and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization respectively. We will also import `LocalOutlierFactor` from `sklearn.neighbors` for outlier detection.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor
```
