# Introduction

In this lab, we will demonstrate how to measure the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error rate for a Random Forest model using the Python scikit-learn library. The OOB error rate is the average error for each training observation calculated using predictions from the trees that do not contain the observation in their respective bootstrap sample. This allows the Random Forest model to be fit and validated while being trained.
