# Import Required Libraries

We will begin by importing the required libraries, including scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib. We will also set a random state value to ensure reproducibility.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import OrderedDict
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

RANDOM_STATE = 123
```
