# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to measure the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error rate for a Random Forest model using scikit-learn. We generated a binary classification dataset, defined a list of ensemble classifiers, calculated the OOB error rate for each classifier, and visualized the results. This technique allows us to estimate the error rate of a Random Forest model without the need for a separate validation set.
