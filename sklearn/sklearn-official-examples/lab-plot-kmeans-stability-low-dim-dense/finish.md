# Summary

In this lab, we evaluated the impact of different initialization methods on k-means clustering algorithm's convergence robustness. We measured the relative standard deviation of the inertia of the clustering and demonstrated one single run of the `MiniBatchKMeans` estimator using an `init="random"` and `n_init=1`. The choice of initialization method for k-means can greatly impact the algorithm's performance and convergence.
