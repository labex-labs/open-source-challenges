# Introduction

Gradient boosting is an ensemble technique where several weak learners (regression trees) are combined to yield a powerful single model, in an iterative fashion. Early stopping support in Gradient Boosting enables us to find the least number of iterations which is sufficient to build a model that generalizes well to unseen data.
