# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the difference in performance between the discrete SAMME boosting algorithm and the real SAMME.R boosting algorithm. Both algorithms are evaluated on a binary classification task where the target Y is a non-linear function of 10 input features. The lab is based on Figure 10.2 from Hastie et al 2009.
