  "description": "In machine learning, feature importance is a valuable tool for understanding which features have the most impact on the target variable. In this lab, we will compare two methods of calculating feature importance: impurity-based feature importance and permutation importance. We will use a random forest classifier on the Titanic dataset to illustrate the differences between the two methods.",
