# Permutation Importances on Lower Capacity Model

We will set `min_samples_leaf` to 20 and train the random forest classifier again. We will calculate the permutation importances of the random forest classifier on the training and test sets. We will observe that the importance of the non-predictive random numerical and categorical features decreases further.
