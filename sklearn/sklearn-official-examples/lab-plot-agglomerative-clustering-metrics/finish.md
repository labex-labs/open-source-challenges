# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated the effect of different metrics on the hierarchical clustering using agglomerative clustering algorithm. We generated waveform data and plotted the ground-truth labeling, interclass distances, and clustering results for different metrics. We observed that the clustering results varied with the choice of metric and that the cityblock distance performed the best in separating the waveforms.
