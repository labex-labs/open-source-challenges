# Introduction

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering method used to group similar objects together. It starts with each object as its own cluster, and then iteratively merges the most similar clusters together until a stopping criterion is met. In this lab, we will demonstrate the effect of different metrics on the hierarchical clustering using agglomerative clustering algorithm.

You can open the `plot-agglomerative-clustering-metrics.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
