# Summary

This lab showed how to use the Classifier Chain algorithm to build an ensemble of logistic regression classifier chains to exploit correlations among the classes. The Jaccard similarity score for each chain tends to be greater than that of the set independent logistic models. Finally, we constructed a voting ensemble of classifier chains by averaging the binary predictions of the chains and applied a threshold of 0.5. The Jaccard similarity score of the ensemble was greater than that of the independent models and tended to exceed the score of each chain in the ensemble.
