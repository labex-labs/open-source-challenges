# Summary

In this lab, we performed outlier detection on two-dimensional Wine datasets using scikit-learn. We used three different classifiers to detect outliers: Empirical Covariance, Robust Covariance, and One-Class SVM. We then plotted the results to visualize the data and the detected outliers. Outlier detection is an important task in data analysis, and scikit-learn provides several tools to perform this task efficiently.
