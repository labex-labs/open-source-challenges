# Introduction

In this lab, we will perform outlier detection on a real dataset using scikit-learn. Outlier detection is the process of identifying data points that significantly differ from the majority of the data. Outliers can be caused by measurement errors, data corruption, or simply represent a rare event. Outlier detection is important in many applications, such as fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and medical diagnosis.
