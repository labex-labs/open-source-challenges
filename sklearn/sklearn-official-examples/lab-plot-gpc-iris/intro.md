# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a famous dataset that contains information about the length and width of the sepal and petal of three different species of Iris flowers. We will use scikit-learn to implement GPC, which is a probabilistic approach for classification tasks.
