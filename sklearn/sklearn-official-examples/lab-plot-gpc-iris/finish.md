# Summary

In this lab, we explored how to use Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn. We defined two versions of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, an isotropic version, and an anisotropic version. We then created a mesh to plot the predicted probabilities for each point on the mesh and plotted the predicted probabilities as a color plot on the mesh. Finally, we plotted the training points for each species of Iris flower.
