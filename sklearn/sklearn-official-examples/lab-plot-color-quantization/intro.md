# Introduction

Color quantization is a process of reducing the number of distinct colors used in an image while preserving its overall appearance. This is done by clustering similar colors together and representing them with a single color value. In this lab, we will use K-Means clustering algorithm to perform color quantization on an image of the Summer Palace in China.
