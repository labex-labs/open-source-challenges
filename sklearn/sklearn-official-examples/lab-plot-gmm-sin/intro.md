# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm to fit a dataset that follows a noisy sine curve. We will use two different types of Gaussian Mixture Models, namely the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model with a Dirichlet process prior.

You can open the `plot-gmm-sin.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
