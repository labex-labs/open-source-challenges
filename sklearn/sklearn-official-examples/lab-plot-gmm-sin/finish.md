# Summary

In this lab, we used the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm to fit a dataset that follows a noisy sine curve. We used two different types of Gaussian Mixture Models, namely the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model with a Dirichlet process prior. We plotted the results and sampled from both models to compare their performance. The choice of the best model is subjective and depends on whether we want to focus on the big picture or closely follow the high density regions of the signal.
