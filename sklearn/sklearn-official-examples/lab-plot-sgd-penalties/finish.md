# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to apply L1, L2, and elastic-net penalties on data using the SGDClassifier in scikit-learn. We generated sample data, applied the penalties, and plotted the decision boundaries. This is a useful tool for regularization in machine learning models, especially for preventing overfitting.
