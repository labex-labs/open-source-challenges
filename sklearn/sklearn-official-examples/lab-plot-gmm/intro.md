# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) using the scikit-learn library in Python. GMMs are probabilistic models that assume that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. They are widely used in various fields such as computer vision, finance, and bioinformatics for clustering and density estimation tasks.
