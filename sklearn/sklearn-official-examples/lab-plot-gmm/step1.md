# Import Libraries

In this step, we will import the necessary libraries for this lab. We will use NumPy for numerical computing, Matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for GMM implementation.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import mixture
```
