# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to implement Gaussian Mixture Models using the scikit-learn library in Python. We have also learned how to generate a dataset, fit the models to the data, and plot the results. GMMs are powerful tools for clustering and density estimation tasks and are widely used in various fields.
