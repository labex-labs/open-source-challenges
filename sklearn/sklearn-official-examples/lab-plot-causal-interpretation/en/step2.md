# Train predictive models with fully observed variables

We train a predictive model, a Linear Regression model, assuming that all variables used by the true generative model are available. We predict the hourly wages using features like experience, parent hourly wage, college degree, and ability. We also plot the model coefficients to show that we exactly recover the values of the true generative model.
