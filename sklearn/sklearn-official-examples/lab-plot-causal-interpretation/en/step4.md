# Lessons learned

Machine learning models are not designed for the estimation of causal effects. While we showed this with a linear model, OVB can affect any type of model. Whenever interpreting a coefficient or a change in predictions brought about by a change in one of the features, it is important to keep in mind potentially unobserved variables that could be correlated with both the feature in question and the target variable. Such variables are called Confounding Variables. In order to still estimate causal effect in the presence of confounding, researchers usually conduct experiments in which the treatment variable (e.g. college degree) is randomized. When an experiment is prohibitively expensive or unethical, researchers can sometimes use other causal inference techniques such as Instrumental Variables (IV) estimations.
