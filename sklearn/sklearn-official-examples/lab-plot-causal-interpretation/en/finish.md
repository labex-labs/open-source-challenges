# Summary

This lab demonstrates that Machine Learning models are not designed for the estimation of causal effects. Omitted-Variable Biases prevent us from identifying the true causal effect of a feature on the target variable. Whenever interpreting a coefficient or a change in predictions, it is important to keep in mind potentially unobserved variables that could be correlated with both the feature in question and the target variable.
