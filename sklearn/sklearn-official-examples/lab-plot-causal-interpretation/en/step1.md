# Generate the dataset

We generate a simulated dataset of hourly wages, work experience, ability, parental hourly wages, and college degrees. Work experience in years and a measure of ability are drawn from Normal distributions. The hourly wage of one of the parents is drawn from Beta distribution. We create an indicator of college degree which is positively impacted by ability and parental hourly wage. Finally, we model hourly wages as a linear function of all the previous variables and a random component.
