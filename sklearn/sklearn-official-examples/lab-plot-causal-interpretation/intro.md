# Introduction

This lab demonstrates that Machine Learning models are great for measuring statistical associations but are unable to infer causal effects without making strong assumptions about the data. We will simulate a situation in which we try to answer one of the most important questions in economics of education: what is the causal effect of earning a college degree on hourly wages? Although the answer to this question is crucial to policy makers, Omitted-Variable Biases prevent us from identifying that causal effect.
