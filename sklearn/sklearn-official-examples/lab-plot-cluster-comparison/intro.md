# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the characteristics of different clustering algorithms on datasets that are "interesting" but still in 2D. The parameters of each of these dataset-algorithm pairs have been tuned to produce good clustering results. While these examples give some intuition about the algorithms, this intuition might not apply to very high dimensional data.

You can open the `plot-cluster-comparison.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
