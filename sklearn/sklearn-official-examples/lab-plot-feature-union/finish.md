# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to concatenate multiple feature extraction methods using Python's scikit-learn library. We used the `FeatureUnion` transformer to combine features obtained by PCA and univariate selection. We also trained a support vector machine (SVM) model and performed a grid search over the hyperparameters of the pipeline.
