# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to concatenate multiple feature extraction methods using Python's scikit-learn library. We will use the `FeatureUnion` transformer to combine features obtained by PCA and univariate selection. Combining features using this transformer has the benefit that it allows cross-validation and grid searches over the whole process.

You can open the `plot-feature-union.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
