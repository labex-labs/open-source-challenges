# Summary

This tutorial provided a step-by-step guide on how to use the scikit-learn library to perform machine learning tasks. We covered generalized linear models, visualizing estimators, scalability and stability improvements to KMeans, improvements to histogram-based gradient boosting estimators, and sample-weight support for Lasso and ElasticNet. Scikit-learn is a powerful tool for machine learning, and with this tutorial, you are now equipped with the knowledge to start using it in your own projects.
