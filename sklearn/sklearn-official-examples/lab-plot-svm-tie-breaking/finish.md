# Summary

This lab illustrated the effect of SVM tie-breaking on decision boundary. We created two SVM models - one with tie-breaking disabled and another with tie-breaking enabled. We then plotted the decision boundary for both models. The decision boundary for the model with tie-breaking enabled was non-convex in the area where the classes were tied.
