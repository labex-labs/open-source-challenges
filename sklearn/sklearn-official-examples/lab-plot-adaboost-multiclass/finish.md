# Summary

In this lab, we explored how boosting can improve prediction accuracy on a multi-class problem. We used a dataset constructed by taking a ten-dimensional standard normal distribution and defining three classes separated by nested concentric ten-dimensional spheres. We compared the performance of the SAMME and SAMME.R algorithms and plotted the test error, classification error, and boost weight of each model. The results showed that SAMME.R typically converges faster than SAMME, achieving a lower test error with fewer boosting iterations.
