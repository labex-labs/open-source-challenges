# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Spectral Biclustering algorithm to cluster data by simultaneously considering both the rows (samples) and columns (features) of a matrix. We generated a checkerboard dataset and bicluster it using the Spectral Biclustering algorithm. We also visualized the results to demonstrate the relationships between the row and column labels assigned by the model.
