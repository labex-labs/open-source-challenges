# Summary

In this lab, we have used the Voting Regressor to predict the progression of diabetes in patients. We have used three different regressors to predict the data: Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression. We have also visualized the predictions made by all models for comparison.
