# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore semi-supervised classifiers on the Iris dataset. We will compare the decision boundaries generated by Label Spreading, Self-training, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the Iris dataset. We will use scikit-learn, a popular Python machine learning library, to implement the classifiers and visualize the decision boundaries.

> You can open the `plot-semi-supervised-versus-svm-iris.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
