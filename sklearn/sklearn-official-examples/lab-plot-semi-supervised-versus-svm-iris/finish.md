# Summary

In this lab, we explored semi-supervised classifiers on the Iris dataset. We compared the decision boundaries generated by Label Spreading, Self-training, and SVM on the Iris dataset. We used scikit-learn to implement the classifiers and visualize the decision boundaries. We found that Label Spreading and Self-training can learn good decision boundaries even when small amounts of labeled data are available.
