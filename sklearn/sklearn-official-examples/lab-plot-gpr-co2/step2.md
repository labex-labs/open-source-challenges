# Design the Proper Kernel

To design the kernel to use with our Gaussian process, we can make some assumption regarding the data at hand. We observe that they have several characteristics: we see a long term rising trend, a pronounced seasonal variation, and some smaller irregularities. We can use different appropriate kernel that would capture these features.

```python
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF, ExpSineSquared, RationalQuadratic, WhiteKernel

long_term_trend_kernel = 50.0**2 * RBF(length_scale=50.0)
seasonal_kernel = (
    2.0**2
    * RBF(length_scale=100.0)
    * ExpSineSquared(length_scale=1.0, periodicity=1.0, periodicity_bounds="fixed")
)
irregularities_kernel = 0.5**2 * RationalQuadratic(length_scale=1.0, alpha=1.0)
noise_kernel = 0.1**2 * RBF(length_scale=0.1) + WhiteKernel(
    noise_level=0.1**2, noise_level_bounds=(1e-5, 1e5)
)

co2_kernel = (
    long_term_trend_kernel + seasonal_kernel + irregularities_kernel + noise_kernel
)
```
