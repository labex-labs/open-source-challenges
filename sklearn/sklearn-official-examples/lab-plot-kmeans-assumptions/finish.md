# Summary

In this lab, we explored the k-means clustering algorithm and its assumptions. We generated different datasets with varying distributions and visualized how k-means partitions this data into clusters. We also discussed some of the limitations of the algorithm and possible solutions to overcome them, including finding the correct number of clusters, increasing the number of random initializations, and using Gaussian Mixture Model.
