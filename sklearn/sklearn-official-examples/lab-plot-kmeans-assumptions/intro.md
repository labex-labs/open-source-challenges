# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the k-means clustering algorithm and its assumptions. We will generate data with different distributions and visualize how k-means partitions this data into clusters. We will also discuss some of the limitations of the algorithm and possible solutions to overcome them.

> You can open the `plot-kmeans-assumptions.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

> Labby cannot automatically verify the answers because it cannot access the notebook.
