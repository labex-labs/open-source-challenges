# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `set_output` API in Scikit-Learn to configure transformers to output pandas DataFrames. This feature is useful when working with heterogeneous data and pipelines in Scikit-Learn.

> You can open the `plot-set-output.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
