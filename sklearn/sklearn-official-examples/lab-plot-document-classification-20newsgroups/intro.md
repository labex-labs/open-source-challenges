# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use scikit-learn to classify text documents into different categories. We will use the 20 newsgroups dataset, which contains around 18,000 newsgroup posts on 20 topics. We will use a bag of words approach and a Tf-idf-weighted document-term sparse matrix to encode the features. The lab will also demonstrate various classifiers that can efficiently handle sparse matrices.
