# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use scikit-learn to classify text documents into different categories. We loaded the 20 newsgroups dataset and used a bag of words approach and a Tf-idf-weighted document-term sparse matrix to encode the features. We trained a classifier twice, once on the text samples including metadata and once after stripping the metadata. We analyzed the classification errors on a test set using a confusion matrix and inspected the coefficients that define the classification function of the trained models. We also trained and tested the datasets with eight different classification models and got performance results for each model. The goal of this study was to highlight the computation/accuracy tradeoffs of different types of classifiers for such a multi-class text classification problem.
