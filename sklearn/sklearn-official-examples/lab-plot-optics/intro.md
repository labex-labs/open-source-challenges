# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the use of OPTICS clustering algorithm using scikit-learn library. OPTICS is an acronym for Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure. It is a density-based clustering algorithm that finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. In this lab, we will generate sample data, plot the reachability plot, and use DBSCAN to cluster the data.
