# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform covariance estimation using regularization techniques such as shrinkage methods. We compared three approaches to setting the regularization parameter: cross-validation, Ledoit-Wolf, and OAS. We plotted the likelihood of unseen data for different values of the shrinkage parameter and showed the choices by cross-validation, LedoitWolf, and OAS estimates.
