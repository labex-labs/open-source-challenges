# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Gradient Boosting to build a predictive model for diabetes regression task. We will train the model on the diabetes dataset and obtain the results from `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` with least squares loss and 500 regression trees of depth 4.

You can open the `plot-gradient-boosting-regression.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
