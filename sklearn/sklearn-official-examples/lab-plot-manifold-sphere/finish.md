# Summary

In this lab, we applied different manifold learning techniques on a spherical dataset. We used Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS), Spectral Embedding, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to gain some intuition regarding the manifold learning methods. These techniques are useful for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data.
