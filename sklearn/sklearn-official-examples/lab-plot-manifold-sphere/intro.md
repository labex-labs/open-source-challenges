# Introduction

Manifold learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with learning the underlying structure of high-dimensional data. In this lab, we will apply different manifold learning techniques on a spherical dataset. We will use dimensionality reduction to gain some intuition regarding the manifold learning methods.

You can open the `plot-manifold-sphere.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
