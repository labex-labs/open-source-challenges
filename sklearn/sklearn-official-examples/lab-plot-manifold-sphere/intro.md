# Introduction

Manifold learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with learning the underlying structure of high-dimensional data. In this lab, we will apply different manifold learning techniques on a spherical dataset. We will use dimensionality reduction to gain some intuition regarding the manifold learning methods.
