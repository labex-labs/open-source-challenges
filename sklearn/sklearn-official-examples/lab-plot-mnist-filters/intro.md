# Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to create an MLPClassifier using Scikit-learn to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. We will also visualize the weights of the first layer of the MLP to gain insight into the learning behavior.

> You can open the `plot-mnist-filters.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
