# Summary

This lab demonstrated two approaches to feature selection: model-based and sequential feature selection. We used RidgeCV estimator to get the importance of features and SelectFromModel to select features based on importance. Sequential Feature Selector is a greedy procedure where, at each iteration, we choose the best new feature to add to our selected features based on a cross-validation score.
