# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about different initialization methods for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). We will use scikit-learn library to generate sample data and visualize the clustering results. There are four different methods for the initialization parameter _init_param_: `kmeans` (default), `random`, `random_from_data`, and `k-means++`.
