# Introduction

This lab will guide you through a step-by-step process of using the Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) algorithm to perform dimensionality reduction on the Iris dataset. IPCA is used when the dataset is too large to fit into memory and requires an incremental approach. We will compare the results of IPCA with the traditional PCA algorithm.
