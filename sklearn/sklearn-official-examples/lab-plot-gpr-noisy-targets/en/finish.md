# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Gaussian Process regression to fit a model to a dataset. We generated a synthetic dataset and used Gaussian Process regression to fit a model to it. We used the scikit-learn library to perform Gaussian Process regression and plotted the mean predictions and 95% confidence intervals.
