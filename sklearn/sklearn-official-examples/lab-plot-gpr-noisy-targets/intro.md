# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Gaussian Process regression to fit a model to a dataset. We will generate a synthetic dataset and use Gaussian Process regression to fit a model to it. We will use the scikit-learn library to perform Gaussian Process regression.

> You can write code in `plot-gpr-noisy-targets.ipynb`.
