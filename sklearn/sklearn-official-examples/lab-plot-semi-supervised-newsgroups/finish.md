# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform semi-supervised classification on a text dataset using scikit-learn. We used Self-Training and LabelSpreading algorithms to train and test our models. Semi-supervised learning can be useful when there is a limited amount of labeled data available, and it can help improve the performance of a model by incorporating unlabeled data.
