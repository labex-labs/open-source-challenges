# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to perform semi-supervised classification on a text dataset using scikit-learn. Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data. This lab will cover how to use Self-Training and LabelSpreading algorithms for semi-supervised text classification. We will be using the 20 newsgroups dataset to train and test our models.

> You can open the `plot-semi-supervised-newsgroups.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
