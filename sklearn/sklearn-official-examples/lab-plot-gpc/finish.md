# Summary

In this lab, we explored Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) with an RBF kernel and different choices of hyperparameters. We generated data, trained the GPC model with both fixed and optimized hyperparameters, and plotted the posteriors and the log-marginal-likelihood landscape. We also evaluated the accuracy and log-loss of the model.
