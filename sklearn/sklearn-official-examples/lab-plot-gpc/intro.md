# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) with an RBF kernel and different choices of hyperparameters. We will generate data, train the GPC model with both fixed and optimized hyperparameters, and plot the posteriors and the log-marginal-likelihood landscape. We will also evaluate the accuracy and log-loss of the model.

You can open the `plot-gpc.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
