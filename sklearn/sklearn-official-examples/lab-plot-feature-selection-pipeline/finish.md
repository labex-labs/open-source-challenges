# Summary

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to build a pipeline with feature selection and SVM classification using Scikit-learn. We showed how to integrate feature selection within the pipeline to prevent overfitting, and how to inspect the pipeline to better understand the model. Pipelines are a powerful tool for building complex models in a modular and efficient way.
