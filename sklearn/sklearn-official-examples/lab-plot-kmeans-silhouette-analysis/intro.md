# Introduction

Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together based on their features. The Silhouette Method is a commonly used technique to determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. In this lab, we will use the Silhouette Method to determine the optimal number of clusters using the KMeans algorithm.
