# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the scikit-learn library to generate a confusion matrix and visualize its results. We loaded the iris dataset, split it into training and test sets, trained a support vector machine classifier, and generated and visualized a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix showed the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class, and the visualization helped us to interpret the results.
