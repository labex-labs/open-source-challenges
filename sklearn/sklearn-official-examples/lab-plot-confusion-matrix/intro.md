# Introduction

The confusion matrix is a tool for evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. It is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted class labels with actual class labels. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the scikit-learn library to generate a confusion matrix and visualize its results.
