# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the K-Means Clustering algorithm and its implementation in Python using the scikit-learn library. We loaded the iris dataset, visualized the data, applied the K-Means Clustering algorithm, and evaluated its performance. Clustering is a powerful technique for data analysis and can be used in a variety of applications.
