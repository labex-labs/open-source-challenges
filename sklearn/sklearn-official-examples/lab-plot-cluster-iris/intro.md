# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the K-Means Clustering algorithm and its implementation in Python using the scikit-learn library. Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that involves grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities. K-Means Clustering is a popular algorithm for clustering and is widely used in various fields such as image processing, bioinformatics, and marketing research.
