# Load Data

Next, we will load the iris dataset, which is a popular dataset in machine learning. This dataset contains information about the characteristics of different types of iris flowers. We will be using this dataset to demonstrate the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

```python
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
```
