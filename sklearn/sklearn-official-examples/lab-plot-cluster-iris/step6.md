# Evaluate Clustering

To evaluate the performance of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, we can calculate the inertia score. The inertia score measures the sum of distances between each data point and its assigned cluster center. A lower inertia score indicates better clustering.

```python
print("Inertia Score:", kmeans.inertia_)
```
