# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the use of Scikit-learn's Lasso regression algorithm on dense and sparse data. The Lasso algorithm is a linear regression method that adds a penalty to the regression coefficients. This penalty encourages the model to produce sparse coefficients. The Lasso algorithm is useful in situations where the number of features is large compared to the number of samples.
