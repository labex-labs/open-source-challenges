# Introduction

This is a step-by-step lab to demonstrate the usage of Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will be using the Iris Dataset, which contains information about the physical attributes of different types of iris flowers. The goal of this lab is to show how to use Scikit-learn to perform basic machine learning tasks such as data loading, data preprocessing, feature selection, and visualization.

> You can open the `plot-iris-dataset.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
