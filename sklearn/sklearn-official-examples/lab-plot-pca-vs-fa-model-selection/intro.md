# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore two probabilistic models - Probabilistic PCA and Factor Analysis - and compare their effectiveness in model selection and covariance estimation. We will perform cross-validation on low rank data that is corrupted with homoscedastic or heteroscedastic noise. In addition, we will compare the model likelihood to the likelihoods obtained from shrinkage covariance estimators.
