# Summary

This lab compared different anomaly detection algorithms on two-dimensional datasets. The datasets contained one or two modes (regions of high density) to illustrate the ability of algorithms to cope with multimodal data. Decision boundaries between inliers and outliers were displayed in black except for Local Outlier Factor (LOF) as it had no predict method to be applied on new data when it was used for outlier detection. The :class:`~sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM` was found to be sensitive to outliers and thus did not perform very well for outlier detection. The :class:`sklearn.linear_model.SGDOneClassSVM` was an implementation of the One-Class SVM based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The :class:`sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope` assumed the data was Gaussian and learned an ellipse, and :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` and :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` seemed to perform reasonably well for multi-modal data sets.
