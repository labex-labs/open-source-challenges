# Summary

This lab provided a step-by-step guide on how to construct and display pipelines in Scikit-Learn. We covered simple pipelines with a preprocessing step and classifier, pipelines chaining multiple preprocessing steps and a classifier, pipelines with dimensionality reduction and a classifier, complex pipelines chaining a column transformer and a classifier, and grid searches over pipelines with a classifier.
