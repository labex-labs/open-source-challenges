# Summary

In this lab, we learned about two ways to display estimators and pipelines using scikit-learn: compact text representation and rich HTML representation. These representations can be useful for summarizing the structure of pipelines and other composite estimators and for comparing different instances. By using these techniques, we can improve our understanding of machine learning models and their performance.
