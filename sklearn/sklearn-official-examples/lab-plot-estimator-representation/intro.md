# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about different ways to display estimators and pipelines using scikit-learn. Estimators and pipelines are an essential part of the scikit-learn package, allowing us to build and evaluate machine learning models.

> You can open the `plot-estimator-representation.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
