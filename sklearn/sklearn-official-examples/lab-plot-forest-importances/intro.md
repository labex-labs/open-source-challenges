# Introduction

In this lab, we will use random forest to evaluate the importance of features on an artificial classification task. We will generate a synthetic dataset with only 3 informative features. The feature importances of the forest will be plotted, along with their inter-trees variability represented by the error bars.

You can open the `plot-forest-importances.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
