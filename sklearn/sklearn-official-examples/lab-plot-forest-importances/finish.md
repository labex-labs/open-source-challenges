# Summary

In this lab, we generated a synthetic dataset with only 3 informative features and used random forest to evaluate the importance of features. We plotted the feature importances of the forest, along with their inter-trees variability represented by the error bars. We used impurity-based importance and feature permutation importance to compute the feature importances. The same features were detected as most important using both methods.
