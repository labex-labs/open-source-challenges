# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about isotonic regression, which is a non-parametric regression technique that finds a non-decreasing approximation of a function while minimizing the mean squared error on the training data. We will use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, to implement isotonic regression and compare it with linear regression.
