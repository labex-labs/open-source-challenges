# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use a logistic regression algorithm to classify hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. We will use the SAGA algorithm to fit a multinomial logistic regression with L1 penalty on a subset of the MNIST digits classification task.

You can open the `plot-sparse-logistic-regression-mnist.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
