# Introduction

The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is a mathematical theorem that states that any high dimensional dataset can be randomly projected into a lower dimensional Euclidean space while controlling the distortion in the pairwise distances. In this lab, we will explore the theoretical bounds of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma for embedding with random projections and validate it empirically using Python scikit-learn.
