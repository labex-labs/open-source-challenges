# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to show how to use the `LearningCurveDisplay` class from scikit-learn to plot learning curves. Learning curves show the effect of adding more samples during the training process. We will analyze the learning curve of a naive Bayes classifier and a SVM classifier with a RBF kernel using the digits dataset. Additionally, we will look at the scalability of these predictive models by looking at their computational cost and not only at their statistical accuracy.
