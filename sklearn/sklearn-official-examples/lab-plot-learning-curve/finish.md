# Summary

In this lab, we showed how to use the `LearningCurveDisplay` class from scikit-learn to plot learning curves. We analyzed the learning curve of a naive Bayes classifier and a SVM classifier with a RBF kernel using the digits dataset. Additionally, we looked at the scalability of these predictive models by looking at their computational cost and not only at their statistical accuracy. We saw that the scalability of the SVM and naive Bayes classifiers is very different. The SVM classifier complexity at fit and score time increases rapidly with the number of samples. In contrast, the naive Bayes classifier scales much better with a lower complexity at fit and score time. We also checked the trade-off between increased training time and the cross-validation score.
