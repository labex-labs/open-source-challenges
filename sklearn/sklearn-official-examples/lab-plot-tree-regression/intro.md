# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the decision tree regression algorithm to fit a sine curve with additional noisy observation. The decision trees will be used to learn local linear regressions approximating the sine curve. We will see that if the maximum depth of the tree is set too high, the decision trees learn too fine details of the training data and learn from the noise, i.e. they overfit.
