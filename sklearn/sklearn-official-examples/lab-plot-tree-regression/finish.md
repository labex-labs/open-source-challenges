# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the decision tree regression algorithm to fit a sine curve with additional noisy observation. We saw that if the maximum depth of the tree is set too high, the decision trees learn too fine details of the training data and learn from the noise, i.e. they overfit. We also learned how to plot the results to visualize how the models fit the data.
