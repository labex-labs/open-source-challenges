# Define Classifiers

We will define two classifiers: one using KNN and the other using NCA and KNN. We will use pipelines to scale the data and apply the classifiers.

```python
names = ["KNN", "NCA, KNN"]

classifiers = [
    Pipeline(
        [
            ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
            ("knn", KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=n_neighbors)),
        ]
    ),
    Pipeline(
        [
            ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
            ("nca", NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis()),
            ("knn", KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=n_neighbors)),
        ]
    ),
]
```
