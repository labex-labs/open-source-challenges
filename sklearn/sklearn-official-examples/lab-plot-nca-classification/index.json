  "description": "This lab will show how to compare nearest neighbors classification with and without Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA). We will plot the class decision boundaries given by a Nearest Neighbors classifier when using the Euclidean distance on the original features, versus using the Euclidean distance after the transformation learned by Neighborhood Components Analysis. The latter aims to find a linear transformation that maximizes the (stochastic) nearest neighbor classification accuracy on the training set. We will use the Iris dataset which contains 3 classes of 50 instances each.",
