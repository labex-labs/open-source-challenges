# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated how to use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to approximate the solution of a One-Class SVM with an RBF kernel. We compared the results of this approximation to the results of using a One-Class SVM with a kernelized approach. We generated a toy dataset and plotted the results of our models.
