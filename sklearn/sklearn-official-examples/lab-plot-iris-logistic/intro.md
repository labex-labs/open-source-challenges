# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Logistic Regression Classifier to classify the first two features of Iris dataset based on their labels. We will use scikit-learn library to load and preprocess the dataset, create an instance of Logistic Regression Classifier, and fit the data. Finally, we will display the decision boundaries on the scatter plot.

> You can open the `plot-iris-logistic.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
