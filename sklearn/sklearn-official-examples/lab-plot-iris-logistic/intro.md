# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Logistic Regression Classifier to classify the first two features of Iris dataset based on their labels. We will use scikit-learn library to load and preprocess the dataset, create an instance of Logistic Regression Classifier, and fit the data. Finally, we will display the decision boundaries on the scatter plot.

> You can write code in `plot-iris-logistic.ipynb`.
