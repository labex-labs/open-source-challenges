# Summary

In this lab, we used Logistic Regression Classifier to classify the first two features of Iris dataset based on their labels. We loaded and preprocessed the dataset using scikit-learn library, created an instance of Logistic Regression Classifier, and fit the data. Finally, we displayed the decision boundaries on the scatter plot.
