# Load the Data

The first step is to load the Olivetti faces dataset, which contains 400 grayscale images of 64x64 pixels each. The data is split into training and testing sets. The training set contains the faces of 30 people, and the testing set contains the faces of the remaining people. For this lab, we will test the algorithms on a subset of five people.

```python
# Load the faces datasets
data, targets = fetch_olivetti_faces(return_X_y=True)

train = data[targets < 30]
test = data[targets >= 30]  # Test on independent people

# Test on a subset of people
n_faces = 5
rng = check_random_state(4)
face_ids = rng.randint(test.shape[0], size=(n_faces,))
test = test[face_ids, :]

n_pixels = data.shape[1]
# Upper half of the faces
X_train = train[:, : (n_pixels + 1) // 2]
# Lower half of the faces
y_train = train[:, n_pixels // 2 :]
X_test = test[:, : (n_pixels + 1) // 2]
y_test = test[:, n_pixels // 2 :]
```
