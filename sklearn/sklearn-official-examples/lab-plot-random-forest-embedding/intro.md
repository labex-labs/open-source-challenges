# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use hashing feature transformation using totally random trees to map data to a high-dimensional, sparse representation that may be useful for classification. The mapping is entirely unsupervised and very efficient.

> You can open the `plot-random-forest-embedding.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
