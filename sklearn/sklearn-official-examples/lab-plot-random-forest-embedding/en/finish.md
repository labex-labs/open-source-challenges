# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use hashing feature transformation using totally random trees to map data to a high-dimensional, sparse representation that may be useful for classification. We also learned how to visualize the partitions given by several trees and how the transformation can be used for non-linear dimensionality reduction or non-linear classification. We then demonstrated how to use Naive Bayes on the transformed data and compared it with an ExtraTreesClassifier learned on the original data.
