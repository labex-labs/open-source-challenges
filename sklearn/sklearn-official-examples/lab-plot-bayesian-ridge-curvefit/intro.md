# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use Bayesian Ridge Regression to fit a polynomial curve to sinusoidal data. We will generate sinusoidal data with noise, fit it using a cubic polynomial and plot the true and predicted curves with log marginal likelihood (L) of these models, we can determine which one is better.

> You can write code in `plot-bayesian-ridge-curvefit.ipynb`.
