# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use LabelPropagation to learn the labels of unknown samples from labeled samples. We generated a dataset containing two concentric circles and assigned labels to each sample. Then, we used LabelPropagation to learn the labels of the unknown samples and visualized the accuracy of the learned labels.
