# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use LabelPropagation to learn the labels of unknown samples from labeled samples. We will generate a dataset containing two concentric circles and assign labels to each sample. Then, we will use LabelPropagation to learn the labels of the unknown samples.

> You can open the `plot-label-propagation-structure.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
