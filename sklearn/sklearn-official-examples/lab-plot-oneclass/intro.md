# Introduction

This lab will guide you through an example of using one-class SVM for novelty detection. One-class SVM is an unsupervised algorithm that learns a decision function for novelty detection: classifying new data as similar or different to the training set.

> You can write code in `plot-oneclass.ipynb`.
