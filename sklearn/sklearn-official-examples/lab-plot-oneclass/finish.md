# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use one-class SVM for novelty detection. We generated data, fit the one-class SVM model, calculated the number of errors, and visualized the results. One-class SVM is a useful algorithm for detecting anomalies in data, and can be applied to a wide variety of applications.
