# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the TransformedTargetRegressor from the scikit-learn library. We will apply it to two different datasets to observe the benefits of transforming the target values before training a linear regression model. We will use synthetic data and the Ames housing data set to illustrate the impact of transforming the target values.
