# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Scikit-learn Libsvm GUI, which is a simple graphical frontend for Libsvm mainly intended for didactic purposes. You can create data points by point and click and visualize the decision region induced by different kernels and parameter settings.

You can open the `svm-gui.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
