# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use PowerTransformer to map data from various distributions to a normal distribution using Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transforms. We also learned how to use QuantileTransformer to force any arbitrary distribution into a Gaussian distribution. It is important to visualize the data before and after transformation, as some transformations may be ineffective with certain datasets.
