  "title": "Hierarchical Clustering With Connectivity Constraints",
  "description": "This lab demonstrates how to perform hierarchical clustering with connectivity constraints using the Scikit-learn library in Python. In hierarchical clustering, clusters are formed by recursively merging or splitting them based on the distance between them. Connectivity constraints can be used to restrict the formation of clusters based on the connectivity between data points, which can result in more meaningful clusters.",
