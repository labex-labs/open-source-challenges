# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to perform hierarchical clustering with connectivity constraints using the Scikit-learn library in Python. We first generated the Swiss Roll dataset and performed unstructured hierarchical clustering. We then defined k-Nearest Neighbors with 10 neighbors and performed structured hierarchical clustering. Finally, we plotted both the unstructured and structured hierarchical clusters using the `matplotlib` library.
