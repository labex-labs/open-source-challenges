# Summary

This tutorial compared the performance of Regular K-Means algorithm and Bisecting K-Means using sample data generated from scikit-learn. We visualized the results using subplots with scatter plots representing the data points and the cluster centroids. We found that the Bisecting K-Means algorithm tends to create clusters that have a more regular large-scale structure, whereas the Regular K-Means algorithm creates different clusterings when increasing n_clusters.
