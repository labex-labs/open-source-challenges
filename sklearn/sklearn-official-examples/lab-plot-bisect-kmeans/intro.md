# Introduction

This is a step-by-step tutorial to compare the performance of Regular K-Means algorithm and Bisecting K-Means. The tutorial will demonstrate the differences between these algorithms in terms of clustering with increasing n_clusters.

> You can open the `plot-bisect-kmeans.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
