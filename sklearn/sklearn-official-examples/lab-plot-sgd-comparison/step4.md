# Interpret the results

We can observe from the plot that the SGDClassifier, Perceptron, and Passive-Aggressive classifiers perform similarly, with the Passive-Aggressive II classifier having slightly better performance. The LogisticRegression classifier performs the best overall, with the lowest test error rate for all proportions of training data.
