# Summary

In this lab, we compared the performance of different online solvers for the classification of handwritten digits. We observed that the LogisticRegression classifier performs the best overall, and that the SGDClassifier, Perceptron, and Passive-Aggressive classifiers perform similarly. This comparison can help us choose the most appropriate classifier for our specific problem and dataset.
