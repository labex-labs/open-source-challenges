# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to model species' geographic distributions using machine learning. We used the OneClassSVM algorithm from the scikit-learn library to model the geographic distribution of two South American mammals given past observations and 14 environmental variables. We also learned how to plot the species distribution and compute the area under the ROC curve to evaluate the performance of our model.
