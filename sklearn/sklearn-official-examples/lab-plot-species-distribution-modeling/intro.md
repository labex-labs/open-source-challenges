# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to model species' geographic distributions using machine learning. This is an important problem in conservation biology, as it helps us understand the distribution of different species and design effective conservation strategies. We will use a dataset of two South American mammals given past observations and 14 environmental variables. We will use the OneClassSVM algorithm from the scikit-learn library to model the geographic distribution of these two species.
