# Import Libraries

In this step, we will import the necessary libraries for our analysis. We will import the scikit-learn library for machine learning, numpy for numerical computing, and matplotlib for visualization.

```python
from time import time

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.utils import Bunch
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_species_distributions
from sklearn import svm, metrics
```
