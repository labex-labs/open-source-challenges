# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of implementing the Mean-Shift Clustering Algorithm using the Scikit-learn library in Python. You will learn how to generate sample data, compute clustering with MeanShift, and plot the results.

> You can open the `plot-mean-shift.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
