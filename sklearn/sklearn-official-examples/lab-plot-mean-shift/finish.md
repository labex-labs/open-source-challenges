# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to implement the Mean-Shift Clustering Algorithm using the Scikit-learn library in Python. We generated sample data, computed clustering with MeanShift, and plotted the results. By the end of this lab, you should have a better understanding of how to use the Mean-Shift algorithm to cluster data.
