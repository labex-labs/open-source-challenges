# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform joint feature selection using the multi-task Lasso algorithm. We generated some sample data, fit models to it using Lasso and multi-task Lasso, and plotted the results. We can see that the multi-task Lasso algorithm is better able to select relevant features across all tasks compared to the Lasso algorithm.
