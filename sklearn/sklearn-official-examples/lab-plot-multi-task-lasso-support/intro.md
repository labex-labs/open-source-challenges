# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to perform joint feature selection using the multi-task Lasso algorithm. We will use scikit-learn, a popular Python machine learning library, to generate some sample data and fit models to it. We will then plot the results of the models to see how they compare.

> You can write code in `plot-multi-task-lasso-support.ipynb`.
