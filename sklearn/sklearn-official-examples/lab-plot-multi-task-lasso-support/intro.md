# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to perform joint feature selection using the multi-task Lasso algorithm. We will use scikit-learn, a popular Python machine learning library, to generate some sample data and fit models to it. We will then plot the results of the models to see how they compare.

You can open the `plot-multi-task-lasso-support.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
