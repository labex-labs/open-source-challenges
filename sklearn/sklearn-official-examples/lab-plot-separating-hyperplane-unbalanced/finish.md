# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classes that are unbalanced. We used the `make_blobs` function to create two clusters of random points and created two SVM models, one with plain SVM and another with automatic correction for unbalanced classes. We plotted the samples and the decision functions for both classifiers and added a legend to the plot.
