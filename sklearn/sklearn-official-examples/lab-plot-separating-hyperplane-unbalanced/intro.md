# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classes that are unbalanced. We will first find the separating plane with a plain SVM and then plot (dashed) the separating hyperplane with automatic correction for unbalanced classes. We will use the `make_blobs` function to create two clusters of random points.

> You can open the `plot-separating-hyperplane-unbalanced.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
