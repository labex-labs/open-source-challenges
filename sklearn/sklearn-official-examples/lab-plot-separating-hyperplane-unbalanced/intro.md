# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classes that are unbalanced. We will first find the separating plane with a plain SVM and then plot (dashed) the separating hyperplane with automatic correction for unbalanced classes. We will use the `make_blobs` function to create two clusters of random points.

> You can write code in `plot-separating-hyperplane-unbalanced.ipynb`.
