# Introduction

This lab will guide you through implementing a Gradient Boosting Classifier with out-of-bag (OOB) estimates using the scikit-learn library in Python. OOB estimates are an alternative to cross-validation estimates and can be computed on-the-fly without the need for repeated model fitting. This lab will cover the following steps:

1. Generate data
2. Fit classifier with OOB estimates
3. Estimate best number of iterations using cross-validation
4. Compute best number of iterations for test data
5. Plot the results

You can open the `plot-gradient-boosting-oob.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
