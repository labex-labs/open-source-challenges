# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to implement a Gradient Boosting Classifier with out-of-bag estimates and estimate the best number of iterations using cross-validation. We also computed the best number of iterations for the test data and plotted the results to visualize the performance of the model for different numbers of iterations.
