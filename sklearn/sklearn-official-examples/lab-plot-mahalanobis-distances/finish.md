# Summary

In this lab, we learned about robust covariance estimation with Mahalanobis distances on Gaussian distributed data. We compared the performance of the MCD and MLE based covariance estimators in calculating the Mahalanobis distances of a contaminated dataset. We observed that the MCD based robust estimator is much more resistant to the outlier samples and that the MCD based Mahalanobis distances are better at distinguishing outliers.
