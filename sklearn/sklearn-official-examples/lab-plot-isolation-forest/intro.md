# Introduction

In this lab, we will go through the process of using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection. We will start by generating a dataset with two clusters and some outliers, then train an Isolation Forest model to identify the outliers. Finally, we will visualize the decision boundary of the model to see how it separates the inliers and outliers.
