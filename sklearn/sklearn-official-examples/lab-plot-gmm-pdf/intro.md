# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to generate a Gaussian mixture dataset. We will then fit a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the dataset and plot the density estimation of the mixture of Gaussians. GMMs can be used to model and estimate the probability distribution of a dataset.

You can open the `plot-gmm-pdf.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
