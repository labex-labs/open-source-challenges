# Import Libraries

We will start by importing the necessary libraries: NumPy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualizations. We will also import the GaussianMixture class from the scikit-learn library to fit the GMM to our dataset.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import mixture
```
