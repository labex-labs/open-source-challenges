# Summary

In this lab, we explored how to use the scikit-learn visualization API to plot ROC curves for two different classifiers. We started by loading the wine dataset and training a support vector classifier on the training data. We then plotted the ROC curve for this classifier using the `RocCurveDisplay` function. Finally, we trained a random forest classifier and plotted its ROC curve alongside the SVC ROC curve. The scikit-learn visualization API makes it easy to compare different classifiers and visualize their performance.
