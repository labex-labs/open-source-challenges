# Introduction

Scikit-learn is a popular Python library that provides a simple and efficient API for machine learning tasks. One of the key features of scikit-learn is its built-in visualization API, which makes it easy to generate visualizations for machine learning models. In this lab, we will explore how to use the scikit-learn visualization API to compare ROC curves for two different classifiers.
