# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to plot the decision surface of two logistic regression models, namely the multinomial logistic regression and the one-vs-rest logistic regression. We used a 3-class dataset and compared the performance of the two models by plotting their decision boundary. We observed that the multinomial logistic regression model had a smoother decision boundary, while the one-vs-rest logistic regression model had three separate decision boundaries for each class.
