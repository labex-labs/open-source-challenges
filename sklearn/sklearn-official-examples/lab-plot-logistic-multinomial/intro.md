# Introduction

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that can be used for binary and multi-class classification problems. In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to plot the decision surface of two logistic regression models, namely the multinomial logistic regression and the one-vs-rest logistic regression. We will use a 3-class dataset and plot the decision boundary of the two models to compare their performance.
