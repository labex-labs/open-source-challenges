# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about GridSearchCV function in Scikit-Learn. We saw how to load a dataset, define hyperparameters and evaluation metrics, perform the grid search, and visualize the results using a plot. GridSearchCV is an important function to use when searching for the best hyperparameters for a given model.
