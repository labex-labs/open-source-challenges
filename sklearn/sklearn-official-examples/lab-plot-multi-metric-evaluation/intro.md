# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about GridSearchCV function in Scikit-Learn. GridSearchCV is a function that is used to search for the best hyperparameters for a given model. It is an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized by cross-validated grid-search over a parameter grid.

You can open the `plot-multi-metric-evaluation.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
