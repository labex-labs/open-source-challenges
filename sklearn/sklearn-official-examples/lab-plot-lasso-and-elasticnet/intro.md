# Introduction

In this lab, we will demonstrate how to use L1-based regression models to deal with high-dimensional and sparse signals. In particular, we will compare three popular L1-based models: Lasso, Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD), and ElasticNet. We will use a synthetic dataset to illustrate the performance of these models in terms of fitting time, R2 score, and sparsity of estimated coefficients.
