# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use the GraphicalLasso estimator to learn a covariance and sparse precision from a small number of samples. The tutorial covers generating data, estimating the covariance, and plotting the results.

You can open the `plot-sparse-cov.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
