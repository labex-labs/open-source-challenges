# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use different kernels for Gaussian Process Regression in Python's Scikit-learn library. We covered the most commonly used kernels in GPR, including the Radial Basis Function kernel, the Rational Quadratic kernel, the Exp-Sine-Squared kernel, the Dot-Product kernel, and the Mat√©rn kernel. We also learned how to plot samples drawn from the Gaussian process using a helper function.
