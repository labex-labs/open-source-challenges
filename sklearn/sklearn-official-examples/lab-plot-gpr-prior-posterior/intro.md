# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use different kernels for Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in Python's Scikit-learn library. GPR is a non-parametric regression technique that can fit complex models to data with noise. A kernel function is used to determine the similarity between any two input points. The choice of kernel function is important, as it determines the shape of the model that is fit to the data. In this lab, we will cover the most commonly used kernels in GPR.

You can open the `plot-gpr-prior-posterior.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
