  "description": "This lab demonstrates the use of FastICA and PCA algorithm, two popular independent component analysis techniques. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a method of separating multivariate signals into additive subcomponents that are maximally independent. This technique finds directions in the feature space corresponding to projections with high non-Gaussianity.",
