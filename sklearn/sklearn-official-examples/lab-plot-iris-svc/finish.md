# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to plot different SVM classifiers in the iris dataset using Python scikit-learn. We compared different linear SVM classifiers on a 2D projection of the iris dataset and interpreted the results. SVM classifiers are powerful tools for classification problems and can be used for a wide range of datasets.
