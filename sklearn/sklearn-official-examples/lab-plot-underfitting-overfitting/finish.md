# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use linear regression with polynomial features to approximate nonlinear functions, and how to evaluate model performance using cross-validation. We saw that a linear function is not sufficient to fit the training samples, and that a polynomial of degree 4 approximates the true function almost perfectly. However, for higher degrees, the model will overfit the training data and learn the noise of the training data. We can use cross-validation and the mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.
