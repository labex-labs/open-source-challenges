# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform face recognition using eigenfaces and SVMs. We first loaded and explored the dataset, then preprocessed the data by scaling the input data. We then performed PCA to extract features from the input data and trained a SVM classification model. We evaluated the model performance and visualized the predictions and eigenfaces.
