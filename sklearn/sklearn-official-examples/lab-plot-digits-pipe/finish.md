# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to build a pipeline for dimensionality reduction and classification using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Logistic Regression. We have used the scikit-learn library to perform unsupervised dimensionality reduction on the digits dataset using PCA. We have then used a logistic regression model for classification. We have used GridSearchCV to set the dimensionality of the PCA and find the best combination of PCA truncation and classifier regularization. We have plotted the PCA spectrum and classification accuracy for each number of components.
