# Introduction

In this lab, we will build a pipeline for dimensionality reduction and classification using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Logistic Regression. We will use the scikit-learn library to perform unsupervised dimensionality reduction on the digits dataset using PCA. We will then use a logistic regression model for classification. We will use GridSearchCV to set the dimensionality of the PCA and find the best combination of PCA truncation and classifier regularization.
