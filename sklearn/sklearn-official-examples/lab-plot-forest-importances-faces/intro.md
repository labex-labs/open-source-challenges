# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to train a random forest on the Olivetti Faces dataset and evaluate the impurity-based feature importance. We will use the feature importances to create a heat map of the pixel importances. We will also parallelize the construction and computation of the predictions within multiple jobs.

> You can write code in `plot-forest-importances-faces.ipynb`.
