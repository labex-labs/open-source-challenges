# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to train a random forest on the Olivetti Faces dataset and evaluate the impurity-based feature importance. We will use the feature importances to create a heat map of the pixel importances. We will also parallelize the construction and computation of the predictions within multiple jobs.

> You can open the `plot-forest-importances-faces.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
