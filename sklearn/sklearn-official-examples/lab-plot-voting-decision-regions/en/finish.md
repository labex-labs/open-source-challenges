# Summary

In this lab, we used Scikit-Learn's `VotingClassifier` to predict the class of iris flowers based on two features. We trained three classifiers: `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, and `SVC`. We then used `VotingClassifier` to combine their predictions and plotted the decision boundaries. We saw that the `VotingClassifier` decision boundary was similar to the `SVC` decision boundary, but with less complexity in some areas.
