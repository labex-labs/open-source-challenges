# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Scikit-Learn's `VotingClassifier` to predict the class of iris flowers based on two features. We will compare the predictions of `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, and `SVC` classifiers individually, and then use `VotingClassifier` to combine their predictions and see if we get better results.

> You can open the `plot-voting-decision-regions.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
