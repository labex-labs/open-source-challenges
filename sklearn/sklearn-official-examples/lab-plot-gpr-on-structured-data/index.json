  "title": "Gaussian Processes on Discrete Data Structures",
  "description": "Gaussian processes are a popular tool in machine learning for regression and classification tasks. However, they typically require data to be in fixed-length feature vector form, which can be limiting in certain applications. In this lab, we will explore how Gaussian processes can be used on variable-length sequences, such as gene sequences, by defining a kernel function that operates directly on these structures. We will use scikit-learn to implement our Gaussian process models.",
