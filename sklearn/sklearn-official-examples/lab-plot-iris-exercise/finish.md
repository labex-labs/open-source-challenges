# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use different SVM kernels for classification. We trained an SVM model with three different kernels and visualized the decision boundaries for each. We also calculated the accuracy on the test data for each kernel. We found that the rbf kernel produced the best results for the Iris dataset.
