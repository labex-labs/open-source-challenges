# Introduction

This tutorial will walk through the process of using different SVM kernels for classification. We will be using the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of flowers. This dataset has three classes, but we will be using only two of them for binary classification.

> You can open the `plot-iris-exercise.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
