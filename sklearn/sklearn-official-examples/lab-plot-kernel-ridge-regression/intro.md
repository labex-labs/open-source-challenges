# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will compare Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) using Scikit-Learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. Both models learn a non-linear function by employing the kernel trick. KRR and SVR differ in their loss functions and fitting methods. We will use an artificial dataset consisting of a sinusoidal target function and strong noise added to every fifth datapoint.
