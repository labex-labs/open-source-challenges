# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to generate new samples of data. We used the scikit-learn library to implement this technique. We optimized the bandwidth parameter of the KDE using grid search cross-validation. We then sampled new data points and transformed them back to their original dimension using PCA. Finally, we plotted the original digits and the resampled digits side by side in a 4x11 grid.
