# Introduction

Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric density estimation technique. In this lab, we will learn how to use KDE to generate new samples of data. We will use the scikit-learn library to implement this technique.

> You can open the `plot-digits-kde-sampling.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
