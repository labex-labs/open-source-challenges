# Introduction

Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) is a technique used to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space (usually 2D or 3D) while preserving the pairwise distances between the data points as much as possible. It is often used in exploratory data analysis and visualization.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps of performing MDS on a generated noisy dataset using the scikit-learn library in Python.

You can open the `plot-mds.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
