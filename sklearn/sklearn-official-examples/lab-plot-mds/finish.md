# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to perform MDS on a noisy dataset using scikit-learn in Python. We also learned how to visualize the results using matplotlib. MDS is a useful technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space while preserving the pairwise distances between the data points as much as possible.
