# Summary

In this lab, we explored various manifold embedding techniques on the digits dataset. We used different techniques to embed the digits dataset, plotted the projection of the original data onto each embedding, and compared the results obtained from different embedding methods. The results provide insight into the effectiveness of each embedding method in grouping similar digits together in the embedding space.
