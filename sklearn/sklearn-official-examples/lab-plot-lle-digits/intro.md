# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore various manifold embedding techniques on the digits dataset. We will use different techniques to embed the digits dataset, plot the projection of the original data onto each embedding, and compare the results obtained from different embedding methods.

You can open the `plot-lle-digits.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
