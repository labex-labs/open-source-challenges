# Summary

In this lab, we used unsupervised learning techniques to extract the structure of the stock market from variations in historical quotes. We learned how to retrieve the data, learn a graph structure, cluster using affinity propagation, embedding in 2D space, and finally, visualize the output of the 3 models in a 2D graph.
