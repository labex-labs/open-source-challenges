  "description": "In this lab, we will use several unsupervised learning techniques to extract the structure of the stock market from variations in historical quotes. We will use the daily variation in quote price to find which quotes are correlated conditionally on the others. Then, we will use clustering to group together quotes that behave similarly. Finally, we will lay out the different symbols on a 2D canvas using manifold techniques to retrieve 2D embedding.",
