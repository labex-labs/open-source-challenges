# Learning a graph structure

We use sparse inverse covariance estimation to find which quotes are correlated conditionally on the others. Specifically, sparse inverse covariance gives us a graph, that is a list of connections. For each symbol, the symbols that it is connected to are those useful to explain its fluctuations.
