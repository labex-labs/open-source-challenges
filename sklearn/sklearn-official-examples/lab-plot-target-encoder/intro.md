# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the performance of different categorical encoders on a wine review dataset. We will use the target column 'points' as the target variable to predict. We will compare the following encoders: TargetEncoder, OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, and dropping the category. We will also look at how to use the native categorical feature support in `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.
