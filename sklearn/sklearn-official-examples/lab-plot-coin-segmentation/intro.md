# Introduction

In this lab, we will use spectral clustering to segment an image of Greek coins into multiple partly-homogeneous regions. Spectral clustering is a powerful technique that can be used to identify clusters in a dataset based on the similarity between their features. In this lab, we will use spectral clustering to segment an image by creating a graph from voxel-to-voxel difference on an image and then breaking the image into multiple partly-homogeneous regions.

You can open the `plot-coin-segmentation.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
