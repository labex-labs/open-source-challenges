# Introduction

In this lab, we will use spectral clustering to segment an image of Greek coins into multiple partly-homogeneous regions. Spectral clustering is a powerful technique that can be used to identify clusters in a dataset based on the similarity between their features. In this lab, we will use spectral clustering to segment an image by creating a graph from voxel-to-voxel difference on an image and then breaking the image into multiple partly-homogeneous regions.
