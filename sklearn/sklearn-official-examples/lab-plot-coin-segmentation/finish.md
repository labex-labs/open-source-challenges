# Summary

In this lab, we used spectral clustering to segment an image of Greek coins into multiple partly-homogeneous regions. We preprocessed the image, converted it into a graph with the value of the gradient on the edges, applied spectral clustering, and visualized the resulting regions. Spectral clustering is a powerful technique that can be used to identify clusters in a dataset based on the similarity between their features.
