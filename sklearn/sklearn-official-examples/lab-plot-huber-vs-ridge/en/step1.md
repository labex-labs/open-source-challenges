# Import Required Libraries

We will start by importing the required libraries, including numpy and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization, and HuberRegressor and Ridge from scikit-learn for regression modeling.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.linear_model import HuberRegressor, Ridge
```
