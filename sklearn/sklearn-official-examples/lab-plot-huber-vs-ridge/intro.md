# Introduction

In this lab, we will compare the performance of two regression models, HuberRegressor and Ridge, on a dataset with strong outliers. We will generate a toy dataset, add strong outliers to it, and then fit both models to the dataset. We will visualize the results and compare the performance of the models.

You can open the `plot-huber-vs-ridge.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
