# Summary

In this lab, we compared the performance of two regression models, HuberRegressor and Ridge, on a dataset with strong outliers. We generated a toy dataset, added strong outliers to it, and then fit both models to the dataset. We visualized the results and compared the performance of the models. We observed that the HuberRegressor was less influenced by the outliers than the Ridge regressor, and that as the value of epsilon increased, the decision function of the HuberRegressor approached that of the Ridge regressor.
