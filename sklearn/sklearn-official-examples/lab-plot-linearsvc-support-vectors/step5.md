# Obtain Support Vectors

The support vectors are the samples that lie within the margin boundaries, whose size is conventionally constrained to 1. We can obtain the support vectors through the decision function. We will use the `decision_function()` function to obtain the decision function of the model. We will then calculate the support vectors from the decision function.
