# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to plot the support vectors of LinearSVC. We used the `decision_function()` function to obtain the decision function of the model and then calculated the support vectors from the decision function. We also learned how to display the decision boundary on the plot using the `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` class.
