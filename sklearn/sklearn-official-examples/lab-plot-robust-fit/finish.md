# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Python's scikit-learn library to perform robust linear estimator fitting. We fit a sine function with a polynomial of order 3 for values close to zero and demoed the robust fitting in different situations. We used the median absolute deviation to non-corrupt new data to judge the quality of the prediction.
