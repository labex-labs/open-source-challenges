# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Python's scikit-learn library to perform robust linear estimator fitting. We will fit a sine function with a polynomial of order 3 for values close to zero and demo the robust fitting in different situations. We will use the median absolute deviation to non-corrupt new data to judge the quality of the prediction.

> You can open the `plot-robust-fit.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
