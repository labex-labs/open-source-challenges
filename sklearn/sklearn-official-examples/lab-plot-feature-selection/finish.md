# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to use univariate feature selection to improve classification accuracy on a noisy dataset. We generated sample data, performed univariate feature selection, and compared SVM classification accuracy with and without univariate feature selection. We also plotted the feature scores and weights for each feature to see the impact of univariate feature selection.
