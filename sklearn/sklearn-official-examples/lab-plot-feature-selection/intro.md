# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use univariate feature selection to improve classification accuracy on a noisy dataset. Support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the dataset both before and after applying univariate feature selection. For each feature, we plot the p-values for the univariate feature selection and the corresponding weights of SVMs. With this, we will compare model accuracy and examine the impact of univariate feature selection on model weights.
