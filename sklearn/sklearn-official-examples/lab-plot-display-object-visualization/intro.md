# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create visualizations with display objects using scikit-learn. Display objects are classes that allow us to create visualizations directly from their respective metrics. In this lab, we will use the `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`, `RocCurveDisplay`, and `PrecisionRecallDisplay` display objects to create visualizations for a binary classification problem.

> You can open the `plot-display-object-visualization.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
