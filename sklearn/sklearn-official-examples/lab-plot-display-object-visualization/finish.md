# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create visualizations with display objects using scikit-learn. We used the `ConfusionMatrixDisplay`, `RocCurveDisplay`, and `PrecisionRecallDisplay` display objects to create visualizations for a binary classification problem. We first loaded the data and trained a logistic regression model. We then created the confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve using display objects. Finally, we combined the display objects into a single plot using Matplotlib's API.
