# Introduction

Gaussian process regression is a statistical modelling technique used to predict the outcome of a target variable based on input variables. The technique models the distribution of the target variable as a Gaussian process, which is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution. The technique is particularly useful in cases where the relationship between the input and target variables is non-linear.

In this lab, we will learn how to use Gaussian process regression with noise-level estimation in Python, using the scikit-learn library.

You can open the `plot-gpr-noisy.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
