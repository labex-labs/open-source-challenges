# Introduction

In this lab, we will apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a corpus of documents to extract additive models of the topic structure of the corpus. The output will be a plot of topics, each represented as a bar plot using the top few words based on weights.

> You can open the `plot-topics-extraction-with-nmf-lda.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
