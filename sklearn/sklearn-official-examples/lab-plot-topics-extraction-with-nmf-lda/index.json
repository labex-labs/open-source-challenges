  "description": "In this lab, we will apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a corpus of documents to extract additive models of the topic structure of the corpus. The output will be a plot of topics, each represented as a bar plot using the top few words based on weights.",
