# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation on a corpus of documents to extract additive models of the topic structure of the corpus. We have also learned how to plot the topics, each represented as a bar plot using the top few words based on weights.
