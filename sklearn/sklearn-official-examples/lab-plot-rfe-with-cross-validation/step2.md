# Model training and selection

We will create the RFECV object and compute the cross-validated scores. The scoring strategy "accuracy" optimizes the proportion of correctly classified samples. We will use logistic regression as the estimator and stratified k-fold cross-validation with 5 folds.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

min_features_to_select = 1  # Minimum number of features to consider
clf = LogisticRegression()
cv = StratifiedKFold(5)

rfecv = RFECV(
    estimator=clf,
    step=1,
    cv=cv,
    scoring="accuracy",
    min_features_to_select=min_features_to_select,
    n_jobs=2,
)
rfecv.fit(X, y)

print(f"Optimal number of features: {rfecv.n_features_}")
```
