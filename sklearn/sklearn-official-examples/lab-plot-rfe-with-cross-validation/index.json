  "description": "In this lab, we will go through a step-by-step process of implementing Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) using scikit-learn. RFECV is used for feature selection, which is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. We will use a classification task with 15 features, out of which 3 are informative, 2 are redundant, and 10 are non-informative.",
