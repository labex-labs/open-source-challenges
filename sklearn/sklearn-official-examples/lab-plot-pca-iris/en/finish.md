# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset using Python scikit-learn. We loaded the dataset, visualized it in 3D, performed PCA on it to reduce its dimensionality, and finally visualized the reduced dataset in 3D again. PCA is a powerful technique that can be used in many applications to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset and identify the most important features.
