# Summary

This tutorial demonstrated how to plot partial dependence curves for multiple features using the `PartialDependenceDisplay` object. First, we trained a decision tree and a multi-layer perceptron on the diabetes dataset. Then, we plotted partial dependence curves for the decision tree and the multi-layer perceptron for two features. Next, we plotted the partial dependence curves of the two models on the same plot. Finally, we plotted the partial dependence curves for a single feature on the same axes.
