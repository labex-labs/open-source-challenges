# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of plotting partial dependence curves for multiple features. The partial dependence curves are used to analyze the effect of a feature on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model while holding all other features constant. This tutorial will demonstrate how to plot partial dependence curves for a decision tree and a multi-layer perceptron on the diabetes dataset.
