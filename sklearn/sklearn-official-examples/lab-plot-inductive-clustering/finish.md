# Summary

In this lab, we learned about inductive clustering, a method that extends clustering by inducing a classifier from the cluster labels. We used scikit-learn library in Python to implement a meta-estimator which extends clustering and trained a clustering algorithm on the generated training data. We also generated new samples and used the inductive learning model to predict the cluster membership for the new samples.
