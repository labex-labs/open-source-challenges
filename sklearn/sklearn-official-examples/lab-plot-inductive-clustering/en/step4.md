# Declare Inductive Learning Model

In this step, we will declare the inductive learning model that will be used to predict cluster membership for unknown instances. We will use `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn as the classifier.

```python
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
inductive_learner = InductiveClusterer(clusterer, classifier).fit(X)
```
