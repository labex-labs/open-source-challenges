# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about inductive clustering, a method that extends clustering by inducing a classifier from the cluster labels. We will use scikit-learn library in Python to implement a meta-estimator which extends clustering.

> You can open the `plot-inductive-clustering.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
