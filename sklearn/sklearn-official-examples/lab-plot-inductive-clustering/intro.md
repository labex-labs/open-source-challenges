# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about inductive clustering, a method that extends clustering by inducing a classifier from the cluster labels. We will use scikit-learn library in Python to implement a meta-estimator which extends clustering.

> You can write code in `plot-inductive-clustering.ipynb`.
