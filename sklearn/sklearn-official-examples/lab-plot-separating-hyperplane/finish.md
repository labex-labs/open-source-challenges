# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to create a two-class separable dataset, fit an SVM model using a linear kernel, and plot the maximum margin separating hyperplane using scikit-learn. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that can be used for a variety of applications, including image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics.
