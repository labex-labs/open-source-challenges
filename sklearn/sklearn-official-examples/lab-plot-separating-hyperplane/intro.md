# Introduction

In this lab, we will use scikit-learn to create a two-class separable dataset and plot the maximum margin separating hyperplane using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the best boundary or hyperplane that separates the data into different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes.
