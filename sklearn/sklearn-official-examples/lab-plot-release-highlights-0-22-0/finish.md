These features include a new plotting API, Stacking Classifier and Regressor, permutation-based feature importance, native support for missing values for gradient boosting, precomputed sparse nearest neighbors graph, KNN based imputation, tree pruning, retrieving dataframes from OpenML, checking scikit-learn compatibility of an estimator, and ROC AUC now supports multiclass classification.
