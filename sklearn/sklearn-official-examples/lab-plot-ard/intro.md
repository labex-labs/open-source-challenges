# Introduction

This lab uses a synthetic dataset to compare two different Bayesian regressors: Automatic Relevance Determination and Bayesian Ridge Regression. The first part of the lab compares the models' coefficients with respect to the true coefficients by using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model as a baseline. In the last section, the lab plots predictions and uncertainties for the ARD and the Bayesian Ridge regressions using a polynomial feature expansion to fit a non-linear relationship between `X` and `y`.
