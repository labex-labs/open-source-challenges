# Summary

This lab compares two different Bayesian regressors using a synthetic dataset. The first part of the lab compares the models' coefficients with respect to the true coefficients by using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model as a baseline. In the last section, the lab plots predictions and uncertainties for the ARD and the Bayesian Ridge regressions using a polynomial feature expansion to fit a non-linear relationship between `X` and `y`.
