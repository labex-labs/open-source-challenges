# Import Required Libraries

The first step is to import the required libraries for this lab. We will be using numpy, matplotlib, fetch_species_distributions, and KernelDensity libraries in this lab.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_species_distributions
from sklearn.neighbors import KernelDensity
```
