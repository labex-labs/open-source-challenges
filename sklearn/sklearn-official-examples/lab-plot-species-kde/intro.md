# Introduction

This lab demonstrates an example of a neighbors-based query (in particular a kernel density estimate) on geospatial data, using a Ball Tree built upon the Haversine distance metric -- i.e. distances over points in latitude/longitude. The dataset is provided by Phillips et. al. (2006). The example uses the basemap library to plot the coastlines and national boundaries of South America.
