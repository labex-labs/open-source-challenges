# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use scikit-learn to plot validation curves for a support vector machine classifier. We loaded a dataset, defined a range of hyperparameter values, computed the validation scores, and plotted the results. This can help in selecting the best hyperparameters for a model and improving its performance.
