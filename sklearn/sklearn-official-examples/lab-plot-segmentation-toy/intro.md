# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to perform image segmentation using spectral clustering. We will generate an image with multiple connected circles and use spectral clustering to separate the circles.

You can open the `plot-segmentation-toy.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
