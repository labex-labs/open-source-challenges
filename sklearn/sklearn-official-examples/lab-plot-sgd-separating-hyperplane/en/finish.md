# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to classify data. We generated a dataset that is suitable for classification, trained the SVM model using SGD, and plotted the maximum margin separating hyperplane. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that is widely used in machine learning for classification and regression analysis. The idea behind SVM is to find the best hyperplane that separates the data into classes with the largest possible margin. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm that is used to find the best parameters for the SVM algorithm.
