# Fit Non-Linear Quantile and Least Squares Regressors

We will fit gradient boosting models trained with the quantile loss and alpha=0.05, 0.5, 0.95. The models obtained for alpha=0.05 and alpha=0.95 produce a 90% confidence interval. The model trained with alpha=0.5 produces a regression of the median.
