# Fit models and evaluate test accuracy

Fit each model and evaluate the test accuracy by transforming the training dataset and the testing dataset with `model.transform()` and fitting the KNN classifier on the transformed training dataset. Compute the nearest neighbor accuracy on the transformed testing dataset using `knn.score()`.
