# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to apply Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) for dimensionality reduction using the scikit-learn library. This lab compares NCA with other (linear) dimensionality reduction methods applied on the Digits data set. The Digits dataset contains images of digits from 0 to 9 with approximately 180 samples of each class.
