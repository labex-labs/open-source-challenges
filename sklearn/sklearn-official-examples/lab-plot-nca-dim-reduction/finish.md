# Summary

This lab demonstrated how to perform dimensionality reduction with Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) and compared it with other (linear) dimensionality reduction methods applied on the Digits data set. The results showed that NCA enforces a clustering of the data that is visually meaningful despite the large reduction in dimension.
