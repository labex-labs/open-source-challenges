# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use Multiclass Sparse Logistic Regression on the `20newsgroups` dataset using scikit-learn. We will compare the performance of Multinomial logistic regression with one-versus-rest L1 logistic regression.

You can open the `plot-sparse-logistic-regression-20newsgroups.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
