  "title": "ROC With Cross Validation",
  "description": "In this lab, we will learn how to estimate and visualize the variance of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metric using cross-validation in Python. ROC curves are used in binary classification to measure the performance of a model by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR). We will use the Scikit-learn library to load the iris dataset, create noisy features, and classify the dataset with Support Vector Machine (SVM). We will then plot the ROC curves with cross-validation and calculate the mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) to see the variability of the classifier output when the training set is split into different subsets.",
