# Interpret the results

We can observe the decision boundaries for each weight value and how well the algorithm performs in classifying the data points. The "uniform" weight value assumes all neighbors have equal weight, while the "distance" weight value assigns more weight to closer neighbors. We can see that the decision boundaries are smoother with the "distance" weight value, indicating a more accurate classification.
