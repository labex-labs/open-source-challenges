# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the Nearest Neighbors Classification algorithm to classify data points in a 2-dimensional space. We used the Iris dataset to visualize the decision boundaries for each class and observed how the algorithm performs when different weight values are used. We also learned how to interpret the results and observed that the "distance" weight value performs better in classifying the data points.
