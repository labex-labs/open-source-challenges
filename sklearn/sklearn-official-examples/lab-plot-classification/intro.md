# Introduction

In this lab, we will be using the Nearest Neighbors Classification algorithm to classify data points in a 2-dimensional space. We will be using the Iris dataset, which is a commonly used dataset in machine learning. We will visualize the decision boundaries for each class and observe how the algorithm performs when different weights are used.
