# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to impute missing data in a dataset using different techniques in scikit-learn. The dataset used here are the diabetes dataset with 10 features and California housing dataset with 8 features. The missing values can be replaced by the mean, the median, or the most frequent value using SimpleImputer. This lab will investigate different imputation techniques like imputation by the constant value, imputation by the mean value of each feature combined with a missing-ness indicator auxiliary variable, k nearest neighbor imputation, and iterative imputation.
