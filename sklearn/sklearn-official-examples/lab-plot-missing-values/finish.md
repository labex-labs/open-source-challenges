# Summary

This lab demonstrates how to impute missing data in a dataset using different techniques in scikit-learn. We have used California housing dataset and the diabetes dataset to implement different techniques like imputation by the constant value, imputation by the mean value of each feature combined with a missing-ness indicator auxiliary variable, k nearest neighbor imputation, and iterative imputation. We have also visualized the scores using bar plots.
