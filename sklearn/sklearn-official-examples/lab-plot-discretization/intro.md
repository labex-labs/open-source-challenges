# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to discretize continuous features using the KBinsDiscretizer class in Scikit-learn. Discretization is the process of transforming continuous features into discrete features by dividing the feature values into a set of bins. This can be useful when working with linear models that can only model linear relationships, or to reduce the complexity of decision trees.
