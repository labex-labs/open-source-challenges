# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to discretize continuous features using the KBinsDiscretizer class in Scikit-learn. Discretization can be useful when working with linear models or to reduce the complexity of decision trees. We also learned how to train linear regression and decision tree models on both the original and discretized datasets, and how to visualize the results.
