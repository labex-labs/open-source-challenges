# Introduction

This lab demonstrates the use of `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` in scikit-learn to optimize over different classes of estimators in a single CV run. We will be using a support vector classifier to predict hand-written digits from the popular MNIST dataset.

You can open the `plot-compare-reduction.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
