# Summary

In this lab, we used `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` in scikit-learn to optimize over different classes of estimators in a single CV run. We also demonstrated how to store the state of a specific transformer using the `memory` argument to enable caching. This can be particularly useful when fitting a transformer is costly.
