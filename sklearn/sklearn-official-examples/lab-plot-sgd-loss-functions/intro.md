# Introduction

In machine learning, loss functions are used to measure the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The `scikit-learn` library provides various convex loss functions for classification problems. In this lab, we will visualize and compare some of these loss functions.

You can open the `plot-sgd-loss-functions.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
