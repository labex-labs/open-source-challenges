# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to plot class probabilities calculated by the VotingClassifier in Scikit-Learn. We will use three different classifiers, including LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, and RandomForestClassifier, and average their predicted probabilities using the VotingClassifier. We will then visualize the probability weighting by fitting each classifier on the training set and plot the predicted class probabilities for the first sample in the dataset.
