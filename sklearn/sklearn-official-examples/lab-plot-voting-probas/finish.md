# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to plot class probabilities calculated by the VotingClassifier in Scikit-Learn. We have used three different classifiers, including LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, and RandomForestClassifier, and averaged their predicted probabilities using the VotingClassifier. We have then visualized the probability weighting by fitting each classifier on the training set and plot the predicted class probabilities for the first sample in the dataset.
