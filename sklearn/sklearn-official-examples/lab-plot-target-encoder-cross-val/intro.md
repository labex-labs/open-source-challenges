# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `TargetEncoder` class from the Scikit-learn library. Target encoding is a technique used to transform categorical data into numerical data that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. The `TargetEncoder` replaces each category of a categorical feature with the mean of the target variable for that category. This method is useful in cases where there is a strong relationship between the categorical feature and the target.
