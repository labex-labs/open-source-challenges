# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use the `TargetEncoder` class from Scikit-learn to transform categorical data into numerical data that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. We also learned the importance of interval cross-validation in preventing overfitting. We trained a Ridge model on the raw data and evaluated its performance. We also trained a Ridge model with cross-validation and evaluated the coefficients of the linear model. Finally, we trained a Ridge model without cross-validation and evaluated the coefficients of the linear model.
