# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore text vectorization, which is the process of representing non-numerical input data (such as dictionaries or text documents) as vectors of real numbers. We will compare two methods, `FeatureHasher` and `DictVectorizer`, by using both methods to vectorize text documents that are preprocessed (tokenized) with the help of a custom Python function.

> You can open the `plot-hashing-vs-dict-vectorizer.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
