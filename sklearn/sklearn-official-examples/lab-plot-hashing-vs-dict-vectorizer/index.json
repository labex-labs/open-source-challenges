  "description": "In this lab, we will explore text vectorization, which is the process of representing non-numerical input data (such as dictionaries or text documents) as vectors of real numbers. We will compare two methods, FeatureHasher and DictVectorizer, by using both methods to vectorize text documents that are preprocessed (tokenized) with the help of a custom Python function.",
