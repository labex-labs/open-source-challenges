# Introduction

In this lab, we will use Support Vector Regression (SVR) to fit a model to a 1D dataset using linear, polynomial, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels. We will use Python's scikit-learn library to perform the SVR.

> You can open the `plot-svm-regression.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
