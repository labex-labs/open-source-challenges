# Interpretation of Results

It is easier to visually assess the overall performance of different classification algorithms using DET curves than using ROC curves. DET curves give direct feedback of the detection error tradeoff to aid in operating point analysis. The user can then decide the FNR they are willing to accept at the expense of the FPR (or vice-versa).
