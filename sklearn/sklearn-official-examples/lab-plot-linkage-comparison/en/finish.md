# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform hierarchical clustering using Python's scikit-learn library. We used different linkage methods such as single, average, complete, and ward to build our clusters, and analyzed the results based on a few toy datasets. Hierarchical clustering is a powerful technique that can be used to identify clusters of similar data points, and can be useful in a variety of fields such as biology, marketing, and finance.
