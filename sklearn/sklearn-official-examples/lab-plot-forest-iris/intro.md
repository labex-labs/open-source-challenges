# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to plot the decision surfaces of forests of randomized trees on the iris dataset using Python's scikit-learn library. The iris dataset is a commonly used dataset for classification tasks. In this lab, we will compare the decision surfaces learned by a decision tree classifier, a random forest classifier, an extra-trees classifier, and an AdaBoost classifier.

You can open the `plot-forest-iris.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
