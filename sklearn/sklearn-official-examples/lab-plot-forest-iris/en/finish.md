# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to plot the decision surfaces of forests of randomized trees on the iris dataset using Python's scikit-learn library. We compared the decision surfaces learned by a decision tree classifier, a random forest classifier, an extra-trees classifier, and an AdaBoost classifier. We also learned how to define models, plot decision surfaces, and load data in Python.
