# Summary

In this lab, we applied various unsupervised matrix decomposition methods to the Olivetti faces dataset. We used PCA, NMF, ICA, Sparse PCA, Dictionary Learning, K-means clustering, and Factor Analysis to extract different types of features from the data. We also enforced positivity when finding the dictionary and/or coding coefficients in the Dictionary Learning method. Overall, these methods can be useful for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets and extracting meaningful features for downstream tasks such as classification and clustering.
