# Introduction

This lab applies different unsupervised matrix decomposition (dimension reduction) methods from the module `sklearn.decomposition` to the Olivetti faces dataset. The Olivetti faces dataset consists of 400 faces of size 64x64 pixels from 40 individuals, each captured with different facial expressions and lighting conditions.

You can open the `plot-faces-decomposition.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
