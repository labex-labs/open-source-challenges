# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the K-Means clustering algorithm using the scikit-learn library in Python. We will use the handwritten digits dataset, which contains 64 features representing an 8x8 image of a digit, and we will try to group the images together based on the digit they represent. We will compare the different initialization methods for K-Means and evaluate the performance of the clustering using various metrics.
