  "description": "In this lab, we will learn how to transform a signal as a sparse combination of Ricker wavelets using sparse coding methods. The Ricker (also known as Mexican hat or the second derivative of a Gaussian) is not a particularly good kernel to represent piecewise constant signals like this one. It can therefore be seen how much adding different widths of atoms matters and it therefore motivates learning the dictionary to best fit your type of signals.",
