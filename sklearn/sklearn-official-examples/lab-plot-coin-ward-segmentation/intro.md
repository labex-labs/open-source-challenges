# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use hierarchical clustering to segment a 2D image. Hierarchical clustering is a clustering algorithm that groups similar data points together. In the context of image segmentation, hierarchical clustering can be used to group pixels with similar color intensities together, which can be useful in identifying distinct regions or objects in an image.

We will use Python's scikit-learn library to perform hierarchical clustering on an image of coins.

> You can write code in `plot-coin-ward-segmentation.ipynb`.
