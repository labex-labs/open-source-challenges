# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Scikit-Learn estimators to benchmark the prediction latency of various regressors. We measured the latency when doing predictions either in bulk or atomic mode, and we plotted the distribution of the prediction latency as a boxplot. We also estimated the influence of the number of features on prediction time and plotted the evolution of prediction time with the number of features. Lastly, we measured the throughput for different estimators and plotted the prediction throughput for different estimators.
