# Introduction

Nested cross-validation is a technique used to estimate the generalization error of a model and its hyperparameters. It is especially useful when choosing between different models or when hyperparameters need to be optimized. In this tutorial, we will compare non-nested and nested cross-validation on a support vector classifier model using the iris dataset. We will also visualize the difference in performance between the two methods.
