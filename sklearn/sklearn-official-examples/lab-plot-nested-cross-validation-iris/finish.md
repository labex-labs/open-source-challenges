# Summary

Nested cross-validation is a powerful technique to estimate the generalization error of a model and its hyperparameters. It can help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model performs well on new data. In this tutorial, we compared non-nested and nested cross-validation on a support vector classifier model using the iris dataset. We visualized the difference in performance between the two methods using a bar chart.
