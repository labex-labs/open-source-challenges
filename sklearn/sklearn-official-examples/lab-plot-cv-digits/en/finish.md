# Summary

In this lab, we performed 10-fold cross-validation with an SVM model on the digits dataset, testing different values of the regularization parameter C. We plotted the results to visualize the relationship between C and the mean cross-validation score. This is a useful technique for tuning hyperparameters and assessing model performance.
