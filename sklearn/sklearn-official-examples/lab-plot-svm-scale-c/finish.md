# Summary

This lab demonstrated the effect of scaling the regularization parameter in SVMs for both L1 and L2 penalty. For L1 penalty, we observed that the cross-validation-error correlates best with the test-error when scaling `C` with the number of samples. For L2 penalty, the best result comes from the case where `C` is not scaled.
