# Introduction

In this lab, we will use the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to cluster a synthetic dataset. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that identifies core samples in regions of high density and expands clusters from them. This algorithm is useful for data containing clusters of similar density.
