# Summary

In this tutorial, we explored the new features and improvements in scikit-learn 0.24. We learned about Successive Halving estimators for tuning hyper-parameters, native support for categorical features in HistGradientBoosting estimators, improved performances of HistGradientBoosting estimators, a new self-training meta-estimator, a new SequentialFeatureSelector transformer, a new PolynomialCountSketch kernel approximation function, Individual Conditional Expectation plots, and a new Poisson splitting criterion for DecisionTreeRegressor.
