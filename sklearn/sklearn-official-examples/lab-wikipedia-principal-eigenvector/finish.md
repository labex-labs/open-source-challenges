# Summary

In this lab, we used Martinsson's Randomized SVD algorithm implemented in scikit-learn to analyze the graph of links inside Wikipedia articles to rank articles by relative importance according to the eigenvector centrality. We also computed the principal eigenvector score using a power iteration method.
