# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to tune the parameters of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel SVM. The `gamma` and `C` parameters of the RBF kernel are crucial for the performance of the SVM model. The goal is to choose the optimal values of these parameters that maximize the accuracy of the model.
