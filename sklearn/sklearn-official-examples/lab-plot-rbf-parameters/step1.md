# Load and Prepare Data Set

- Load the iris dataset from scikit-learn.
- Separate the data into feature matrix `X` and target vector `y`.
- Standardize the feature matrix `X` using `StandardScaler`.
- Create a simplified version of the dataset for decision function visualization by keeping only the first two features in `X` and sub-sampling the dataset to keep only two classes and make it a binary classification problem.
