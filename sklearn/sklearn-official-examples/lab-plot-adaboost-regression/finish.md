# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform Boosted Decision Tree Regression on a 1D sinusoidal dataset using Python's Scikit-Learn library. We compared the performance of a single Decision Tree Regressor with that of an AdaBoost Regressor with 300 Decision Tree Regressors as base learners. We visualized the performance of both regressors using Matplotlib.
