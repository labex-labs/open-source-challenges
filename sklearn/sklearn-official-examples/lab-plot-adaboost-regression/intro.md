# Introduction

In this lab, we will be using Python's Scikit-Learn library to perform Boosted Decision Tree Regression on a 1D sinusoidal dataset. We will compare the performance of a single Decision Tree Regressor with that of an AdaBoost Regressor with 300 Decision Tree Regressors as base learners.
