# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to use SVM-Kernels to classify data-points. SVM-Kernels are especially useful when the data-points are not linearly separable. We will use Python scikit-learn to carry out this task.

You can open the `plot-svm-kernels.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
