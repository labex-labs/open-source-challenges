# Summary of Cross-Validation Approach

Both algorithms give roughly the same results. Lars computes a solution path only for each kink in the path. As a result, it is very efficient when there are only of few kinks, which is the case if there are few features or samples. On the opposite, coordinate descent computes the path points on a pre-specified grid (here we use the default). Thus it is more efficient if the number of grid points is smaller than the number of kinks in the path. Such a strategy can be interesting if the number of features is really large and there are enough samples to be selected in each of the cross-validation fold. In terms of numerical errors, for heavily correlated variables, Lars will accumulate more errors, while the coordinate descent algorithm will only sample the path on a grid.
