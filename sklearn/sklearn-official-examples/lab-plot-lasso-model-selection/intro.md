# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about selecting the best hyperparameter alpha for Lasso regression models. Two approaches will be discussed: (1) selecting the optimal value of alpha by only using the training set and some information criterion, and (2) selecting the best hyperparameter using cross-validation. We will use the diabetes dataset in this example.
