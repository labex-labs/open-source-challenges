# Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to use permutation importance on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset using `permutation_importance` function from `sklearn.inspection`. The Random Forest Classifier is used to classify the data and compute its accuracy on a test set. We will also show how to handle multicollinearity in the features using hierarchical clustering.
