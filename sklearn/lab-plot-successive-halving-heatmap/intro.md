# Introduction

This lab compares two popular parameter search algorithms in machine learning: Grid Search and Successive Halving. We will be using the scikit-learn library in Python to perform the comparison. These algorithms are used to find the best hyperparameters for a given machine learning model.

> In this lab, You can write code in IPython or in `plot-successive-halving-heatmap.py`.
