# Introduction

Partial dependence plots (PDP) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots are useful tools for visualizing and analyzing the interaction between the target response and a set of input features. PDPs show the dependence between the target response and the input features, while ICE plots visualize the dependence of the prediction on a feature for each individual sample. These plots help us understand the relationship between the target response and the input features.
