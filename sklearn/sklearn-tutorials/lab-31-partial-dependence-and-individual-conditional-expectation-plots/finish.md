# Summary

Partial dependence plots and individual conditional expectation plots are powerful tools for visualizing and understanding the relationship between the target response and the input features. PDPs provide an overall view of the dependence, while ICE plots show the individual variations. By using these plots, we can gain insights into how the target response changes with respect to different values of the input features.
