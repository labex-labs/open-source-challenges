# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform biclustering using the Spectral Co-Clustering and Spectral Biclustering algorithms in scikit-learn. Biclustering allows us to simultaneously cluster rows and columns of a data matrix to identify submatrices with specific properties. Biclustering can be useful in various data analysis tasks, such as identifying patterns in gene expression data or finding structure in image datasets.
