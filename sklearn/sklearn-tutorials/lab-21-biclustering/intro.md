# Introduction

Biclustering is a method that simultaneously clusters rows and columns of a data matrix. This allows us to identify submatrices within the data matrix that have specific properties. Biclustering is useful in various domains, including data analysis, image processing, and bioinformatics.

In this lab, we will learn how to perform biclustering using the `sklearn.cluster.bicluster` module in scikit-learn. We will explore two common biclustering algorithms: Spectral Co-Clustering and Spectral Biclustering. These algorithms differ in how they define and assign rows and columns to biclusters.
