# Summary

Isotonic regression is a useful technique when you have non-linear data that does not meet the assumptions of a linear regression model. By fitting a non-decreasing function to the data, isotonic regression provides a piecewise linear approximation that captures the underlying trend in the data. In this lab, we learned how to use scikit-learn's `IsotonicRegression` class to fit an isotonic regression model, make predictions, and visualize the results.
