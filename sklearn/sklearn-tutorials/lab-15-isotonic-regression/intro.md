# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore isotonic regression using scikit-learn. Isotonic regression is a technique that fits a non-decreasing function to one-dimensional data. It is useful when you have data that does not satisfy the assumption of linearity in a regression model.

> You can open the `15-isotonic-regression.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
