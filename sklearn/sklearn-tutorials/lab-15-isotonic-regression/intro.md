# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore isotonic regression using scikit-learn. Isotonic regression is a technique that fits a non-decreasing function to one-dimensional data. It is useful when you have data that does not satisfy the assumption of linearity in a regression model.

> You can write code in `15-isotonic-regression.ipynb`.
