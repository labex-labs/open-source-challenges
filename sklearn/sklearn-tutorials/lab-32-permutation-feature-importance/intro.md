# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the Permutation Feature Importance method, which is a model inspection technique used to determine the importance of features in a predictive model. This technique can be especially useful for non-linear or opaque models that are difficult to interpret.

> You can open the `32-permutation-feature-importance.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
