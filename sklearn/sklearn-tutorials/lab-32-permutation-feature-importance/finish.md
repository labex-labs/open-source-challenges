# Summary

In this lab, we learned about the Permutation Feature Importance method for evaluating the importance of features in a predictive model. We went through the steps of loading a dataset, training a model, evaluating the model, calculating the feature importances, and interpreting the results. This method can be valuable in understanding which features are most predictive and how much the model depends on each feature.
