# Interpret the results

The calculated feature importances represent the decrease in the model score when a single feature value is randomly shuffled. Features with a higher importance value indicate that the model relies more heavily on those features for its predictions.

In this example, the top features that contribute the most to the model's performance are "s5", "bmi", "bp", and "sex".
