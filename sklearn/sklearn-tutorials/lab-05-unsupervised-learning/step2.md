# Clustering Evaluation

After performing clustering, it is important to evaluate the results. However, in unsupervised learning, we don't have access to ground truth labels. Therefore, we need to be cautious when interpreting clustering results. It is common to evaluate clustering results based on metrics such as silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares. These metrics can provide insights into the quality of the clustering.
