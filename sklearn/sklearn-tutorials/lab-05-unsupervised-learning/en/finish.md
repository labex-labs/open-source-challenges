# Summary

In this lab, we explored the concepts of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering and decomposition. We learned about K-means clustering, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, feature agglomeration, principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA). These techniques are valuable for discovering patterns and structures in unlabeled data and finding lower-dimensional representations that capture the most important information.
