  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the concept of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering and decomposition. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where we don't have labeled data to train on. Instead, we try to find patterns or structures in the data without any prior knowledge. Clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique used to group similar observations together. Decomposition, on the other hand, is used to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data by extracting the most important features or components.",
