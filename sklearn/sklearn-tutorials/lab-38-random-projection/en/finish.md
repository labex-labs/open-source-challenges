# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform random projection for dimensionality reduction using the scikit-learn library. We explored both Gaussian random projection and sparse random projection techniques. We also learned how to compute the inverse transform of the projected data to recover the original data. Random projection can be a useful tool for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data in machine learning tasks.
