# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore random projection in dimensionality reduction using the scikit-learn library. Random projection is a technique that can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving the pairwise distances between samples. This can be useful for speeding up computations and reducing memory usage in machine learning algorithms.
