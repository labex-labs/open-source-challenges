# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore ensemble methods using scikit-learn. Ensemble methods are machine learning techniques that combine multiple models to achieve better performance than a single model. We will specifically focus on two popular ensemble methods: Bagging and Random Forests.

> You can open the `11-ensemble-methods.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
