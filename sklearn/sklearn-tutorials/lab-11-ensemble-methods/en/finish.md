# Summary

In this lab, we explored ensemble methods using scikit-learn. We fit a Bagging Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier on the iris dataset and evaluated their performance. Ensemble methods like Bagging and Random Forests can be powerful tools for improving the predictive performance of machine learning models.
