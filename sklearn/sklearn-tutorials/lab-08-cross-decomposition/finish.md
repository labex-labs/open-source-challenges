# Summary

In this lab, we explored the cross decomposition algorithms provided by scikit-learn. We learned about PLSRegression, PLSCanonical, CCA, and PLSSVD. We also saw how to fit these models to data and transform the data into lower-dimensional representations. These algorithms are useful for dimensionality reduction and regression tasks, especially when there is multicollinearity among the features or when the number of variables is greater than the number of samples.
