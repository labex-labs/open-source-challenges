# Introduction

The `cross_decomposition` module in scikit-learn contains supervised estimators for dimensionality reduction and regression, specifically for Partial Least Squares (PLS) algorithms. These algorithms find the fundamental relationship between two matrices by projecting them into a lower-dimensional subspace such that the covariance between the transformed matrices is maximal.

In this lab, we will explore the different cross decomposition algorithms provided by scikit-learn and learn how to use them for dimensionality reduction and regression tasks.
