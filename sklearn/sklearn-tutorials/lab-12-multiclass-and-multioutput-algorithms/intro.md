# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the functionality and usage of multiclass and multioutput algorithms in scikit-learn. Multiclass classification is a classification task where samples are assigned to more than two classes. Multioutput classification, on the other hand, predicts multiple properties for each sample. We will cover the following topics:

1. Multiclass Classification
2. Multilabel Classification
3. Multiclass-Multioutput Classification
4. Multioutput Regression
