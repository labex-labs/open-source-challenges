# Summary

In this lab, we explored multiclass and multioutput algorithms in scikit-learn. We covered multiclass classification, multilabel classification, multiclass-multioutput classification, and multioutput regression. These algorithms allow us to solve complex classification and regression tasks with multiple targets or classes.
