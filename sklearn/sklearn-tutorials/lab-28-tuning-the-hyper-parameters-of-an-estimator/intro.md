# Introduction

Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learned by an estimator. They are passed as arguments to the constructor of the estimator classes. Tuning the hyperparameters of an estimator is an important step in building effective machine learning models. It involves finding the optimal combination of hyperparameters that result in the best performance of the model.

Scikit-learn provides several tools to search for the best hyperparameters: `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`. In this lab, we will walk through the process of tuning hyperparameters using these tools.
