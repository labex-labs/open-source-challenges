# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to tune the hyperparameters of an estimator using `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`. We defined the estimator and the parameter grid, and then performed grid search and randomized search, respectively, to find the best combination of hyperparameters. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in building machine learning models to improve their performance.
