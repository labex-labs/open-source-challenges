# Load the dataset

Next, we need to load the dataset that we want to perform outlier detection on. You can use any dataset of your choice or create a custom dataset. In this example, we will use a sample dataset called `X_train`.

```python
X_train = [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5]
```
