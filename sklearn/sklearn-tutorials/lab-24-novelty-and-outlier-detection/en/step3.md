# Create an outlier detection estimator

Now, we can create an outlier detection estimator object from the `neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` class. This class implements the Local Outlier Factor algorithm, which is a popular method for outlier detection.

```python
estimator = neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor()
```
