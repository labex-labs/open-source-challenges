# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform novelty and outlier detection using the scikit-learn library. We created an outlier detection estimator, fitted it to the training data, predicted outliers in new observations, and accessed the outlier scores. These techniques can be used to identify abnormal or unusual observations in a dataset and are commonly used for anomaly detection tasks.
