# Summary

In this lab, we explored linear models in scikit-learn. We learned about ordinary least squares, ridge regression, lasso, logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, and perceptron. These models can be used for both regression and classification tasks. We also saw how to fit these models using various algorithms and techniques such as online learning and feature selection.
