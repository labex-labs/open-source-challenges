# Perceptron

The Perceptron is a simple linear classification algorithm suitable for large-scale learning. It updates its model only on mistakes, making it faster to train than the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with hinge loss. The resulting models are also sparser.

Let's fit a perceptron model.

```python
clf = linear_model.Perceptron(alpha=0.1)
clf.fit(X, y)

print(clf.coef_)
```

- We create an instance of `Perceptron` with the regularization parameter `alpha` set to 0.1.
- We use the `fit` method to fit the model to the training data.
- We print the coefficients of the perceptron model.
