# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore linear models in scikit-learn. Linear models are a set of methods used for regression and classification tasks. They assume that the target variable is a linear combination of the features. These models are widely used in machine learning due to their simplicity and interpretability.

We will cover the following topics:

- Ordinary Least Squares
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso
- Logistic Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Perceptron
