# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for training linear classifiers and regressors using the scikit-learn library. We trained a classifier on the iris dataset and measured its accuracy, and we trained a regressor and measured its mean squared error. SGD is a powerful optimization algorithm that can handle large-scale and sparse machine learning problems efficiently.
