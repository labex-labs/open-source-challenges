# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is a powerful optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning for solving large-scale and sparse problems. We will learn how to use the SGDClassifier and SGDRegressor classes from the scikit-learn library to train linear classifiers and regressors.
