# Summary

In this lab, we learned about datasets in scikit-learn, how to reshape data, and the concept of estimator objects. We explored fitting data with an estimator, setting parameters, and accessing estimated parameters. This understanding of the setting and the estimator object will be essential when working with scikit-learn for statistical learning tasks.
