# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the setting and the estimator object in scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will learn about datasets, which are represented as 2D arrays, and how to preprocess them for scikit-learn. We will also explore the concept of estimator objects, which are used to learn from data and make predictions.
