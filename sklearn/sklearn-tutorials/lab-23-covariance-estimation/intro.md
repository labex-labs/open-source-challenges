# Introduction

Covariance estimation is an important statistical technique used to estimate the covariance matrix of a population. The covariance matrix describes the relationship between variables in a dataset and can provide valuable insights into the data's scatter plot shape. In this lab, we will explore various methods for estimating the covariance matrix using the `sklearn.covariance` package in Python.
