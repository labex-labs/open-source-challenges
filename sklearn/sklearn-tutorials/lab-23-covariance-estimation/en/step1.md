# Empirical Covariance

The empirical covariance matrix is a commonly used method for estimating the covariance matrix of a dataset. It is based on the principle of maximum likelihood estimation and assumes that the observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The `empirical_covariance` function in the `sklearn.covariance` package can be used to compute the empirical covariance matrix of a given dataset.

```python
from sklearn.covariance import empirical_covariance

# Compute the empirical covariance matrix
covariance_matrix = empirical_covariance(data)
```
