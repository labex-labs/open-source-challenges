# Shrunk Covariance

The maximum likelihood estimator, although unbiased, may not accurately estimate the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, leading to inaccurate results. To mitigate this issue, a technique called shrinkage is employed. Shrinkage reduces the ratio between the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the empirical covariance matrix, improving the accuracy of the estimate. The `sklearn.covariance` package provides a `ShrunkCovariance` class that can be used to fit a shrunk estimator to the data.

```python
from sklearn.covariance import ShrunkCovariance

# Create a ShrunkCovariance object and fit it to the data
shrunk_estimator = ShrunkCovariance().fit(data)

# Compute the shrunk covariance matrix
shrunk_covariance_matrix = shrunk_estimator.covariance_
```
