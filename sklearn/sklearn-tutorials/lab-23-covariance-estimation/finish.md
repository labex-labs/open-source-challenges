# Summary

Covariance estimation is a fundamental statistical technique used to estimate the covariance matrix of a dataset. In this lab, we explored various methods for covariance estimation using the `sklearn.covariance` package in Python. We covered empirical covariance estimation, shrinkage techniques, sparse inverse covariance estimation, and robust covariance estimation. It is essential to choose the appropriate method based on the characteristics of the dataset and the specific requirements of the analysis.
