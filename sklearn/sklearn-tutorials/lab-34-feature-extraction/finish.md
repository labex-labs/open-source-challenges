# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform feature extraction using the scikit-learn library. We explored various techniques such as loading features from dicts, feature hashing, and text feature extraction. We also learned how to customize the behavior of vectorizer classes to suit our specific needs. Feature extraction is an important step in machine learning as it helps transform raw data into a format that can be used by algorithms to make predictions or classify data.
