# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the preprocessing techniques available in scikit-learn. Preprocessing is an essential step in any machine learning workflow as it helps to transform raw data into a suitable format for the learning algorithm. We will cover various preprocessing techniques such as standardization, scaling, normalization, encoding categorical features, imputing missing values, generating polynomial features, and creating custom transformers.
