# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Decision Trees for classification using scikit-learn. Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. They are simple to understand and interpret, and can handle both numerical and categorical data.

You can open the `10-decision-trees.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
