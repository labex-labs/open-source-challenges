# Import the necessary libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will be using scikit-learn for building and training the Decision Tree classifier.

```python
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```
