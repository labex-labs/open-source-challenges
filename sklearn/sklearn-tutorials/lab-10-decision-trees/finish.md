# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to use Decision Trees for classification using scikit-learn. We loaded the Iris dataset, split the data into training and testing sets, created and trained the Decision Tree classifier, made predictions on the test data, and evaluated the accuracy of the model. Decision Trees are a powerful and interpretable method for classification tasks.
