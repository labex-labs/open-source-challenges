# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique. Clustering is used to group similar data points together based on their features or attributes, without the need for labeled training data. There are various clustering algorithms available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this lab, we will focus on the k-means clustering algorithm.
