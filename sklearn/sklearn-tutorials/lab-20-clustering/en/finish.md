# Summary

In this lab, we explored the k-means clustering algorithm. We generated a synthetic dataset, performed k-means clustering on the data, and visualized the resulting clusters. We also calculated the inertia of the clusters as a measure of clustering performance. Clustering is a powerful technique for finding structure in unlabeled data and can be applied to various domains and types of data.
