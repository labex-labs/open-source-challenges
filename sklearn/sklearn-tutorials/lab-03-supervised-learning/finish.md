# Summary

In this lab, we learned about different supervised learning techniques and how to implement them using scikit-learn. We covered nearest neighbor classification, linear regression, and support vector machines (SVMs). These techniques allow us to predict output variables from high-dimensional observations and classify data into different categories. By applying these techniques to real-world datasets, we can gain insights and make predictions in various domains such as healthcare, finance, and social sciences.
