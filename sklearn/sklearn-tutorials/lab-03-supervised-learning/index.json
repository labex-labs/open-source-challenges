  "description": "In supervised learning, we want to learn the relationship between two datasets: the observed data `X` and an external variable `y` that we want to predict.\nThere are two main types of supervised learning problems: classification and regression. In classification, the goal is to predict the class or category of an observation, while in regression, the goal is to predict a continuous target variable.\n\nIn this lab, we will explore the concepts of supervised learning and see how to implement them using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will cover topics such as nearest neighbor classification, linear regression, and support vector machines (SVMs).",
