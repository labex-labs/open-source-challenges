# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about the process of model selection in scikit-learn. We explored scoring methods, cross-validation, grid-search, and cross-validated estimators. By following these steps, you can choose the best estimator for a given dataset and tune its parameters to achieve optimal performance.
