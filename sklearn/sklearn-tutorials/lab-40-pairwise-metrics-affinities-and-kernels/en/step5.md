# Summary

In this lab, we explored the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` submodule in scikit-learn. We learned about different pairwise metrics and kernels, their definitions, and how to use them to calculate distances and affinities between samples.

Using the `pairwise_distances` function, we calculated the pairwise distances between sets of samples. Using the `pairwise_kernels` function, we computed the pairwise kernels between sets of samples using various kernel functions.

We also explored the `cosine_similarity` function to calculate the cosine similarity between vectors, and the `polynomial_kernel` function to compute the polynomial kernel.

These pairwise metrics and kernels are useful in various machine learning tasks, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and similarity-based analysis.
