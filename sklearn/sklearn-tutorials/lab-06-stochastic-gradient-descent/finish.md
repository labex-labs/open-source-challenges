# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to implement Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) using scikit-learn. We loaded the iris dataset, preprocessed the data, split it into training and test sets, trained an SGD classifier, made predictions, and evaluated the classifier's performance. SGD is a powerful optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning for large-scale problems.
