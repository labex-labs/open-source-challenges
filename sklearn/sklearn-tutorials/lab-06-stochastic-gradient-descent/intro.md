# Introduction

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning. It is a variation of the gradient descent algorithm that uses a randomly selected subset of the training data at each iteration. This makes it computationally efficient and suitable for handling large datasets. In this lab, we will walk through the steps of implementing SGD in Python using scikit-learn.
