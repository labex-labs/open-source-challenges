# Summary

In this lab, we learned about neural network models, specifically the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm. We imported the necessary libraries, loaded the dataset, created and trained an MLP model, made predictions with the trained model, and evaluated the model's accuracy.

MLP is a powerful algorithm that can learn non-linear patterns in data and is widely used for classification and regression tasks. It can be a useful tool in your machine learning toolbox.
