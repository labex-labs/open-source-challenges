# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about neural network models and how they can be used in supervised learning tasks. Neural networks are a popular type of machine learning algorithm that can learn non-linear patterns in data. They are often used for classification and regression tasks.

We will specifically focus on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm, which is a type of neural network that has one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. MLP can learn complex non-linear relationships in data, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks.
