# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to implement cross-validation using the scikit-learn library in Python. We split the dataset into training and test sets, trained a model on the training set, and evaluated its performance on the test set. Cross-validation helps to prevent overfitting and provides a better estimate of how well a model will generalize to new, unseen data.
