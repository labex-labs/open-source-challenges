# Introduction

In machine learning, cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model on an independent dataset. It helps to prevent overfitting by providing a better estimate of how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data.

In this lab, we will explore the concept of cross-validation and how to implement it using the scikit-learn library in Python.
