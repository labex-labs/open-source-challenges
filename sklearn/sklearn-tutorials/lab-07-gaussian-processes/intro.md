# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore Gaussian Processes (GP), a supervised learning method used for regression and probabilistic classification problems. Gaussian Processes are versatile and can interpolate observations, provide probabilistic predictions, and handle different types of kernels. In this lab, we will focus on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) using the scikit-learn library.

> You can open the `07-gaussian-processes.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
