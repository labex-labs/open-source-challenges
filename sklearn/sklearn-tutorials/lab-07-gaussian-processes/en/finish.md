# Summary

In this lab, we explored Gaussian Processes (GP) and their applications for regression and classification tasks. We learned how to use the GaussianProcessRegressor and GaussianProcessClassifier classes from scikit-learn, and how to specify different types of kernels for GPs. We also saw examples of GPR for regression tasks and GPC for multi-class classification tasks, demonstrating the versatility and capabilities of Gaussian Processes.
