# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned about Support Vector Machines (SVM) and its applications in classification, regression, density estimation, and novelty detection. We covered the steps for classification, multi-class classification, scores and probabilities, unbalanced problems, regression, and density estimation. SVMs are powerful tools for machine learning and can be used in various scenarios to achieve accurate predictions.
