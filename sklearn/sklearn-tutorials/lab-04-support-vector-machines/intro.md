# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn about Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and can still perform well when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

The advantages of SVMs include their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces, memory efficiency, and versatility in terms of different kernel functions. However, it is important to avoid overfitting and choose the right kernel and regularization term for the given problem.

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

1. Classification with SVM
2. Multi-class classification
3. Scores and probabilities
4. Unbalanced problems
5. Regression with SVM
6. Density estimation and novelty detection
