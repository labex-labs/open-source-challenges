# Summary

In this lab, we explored the concept of validation curves and how they can be used to evaluate machine learning models. By plotting the training score and the validation score for different hyperparameter values, we can determine if a model is overfitting or underfitting. This information helps us select the best hyperparameters for our models and improve their performance.
