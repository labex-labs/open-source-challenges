# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore manifold learning, which is an approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction is often used to visualize high-dimensional datasets, as it can be difficult to interpret data in more than three dimensions. Manifold learning algorithms aim to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the underlying structure.

In this lab, we will use the scikit-learn library to perform manifold learning on various datasets. We will explore different algorithms and compare their performance and outputs.
