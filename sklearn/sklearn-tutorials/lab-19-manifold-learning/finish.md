# Summary

Manifold learning is a powerful tool for visualizing high-dimensional datasets. It allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the underlying structure. In this lab, we explored three different manifold learning algorithms: Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and t-SNE. We applied these algorithms to various datasets and compared their results. By using manifold learning, we can gain insights into the structure of complex datasets and more effectively analyze and visualize high-dimensional data.
