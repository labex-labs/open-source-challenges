# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and how to use them for clustering and density estimation using the scikit-learn library in Python. Gaussian mixture models are a type of probabilistic model that assume data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. They are a generalization of k-means clustering that incorporate information about the covariance structure of the data.
