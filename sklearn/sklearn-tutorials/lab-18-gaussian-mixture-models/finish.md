# Summary

In this lab, we learned about Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and how to use them for clustering and density estimation in Python using the scikit-learn library. We followed a step-by-step process including data loading and preprocessing, fitting a GMM, clustering the data, and visualizing the results. GMMs are a powerful tool for modeling complex data distributions and can be used in a variety of applications such as image segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommender systems.
