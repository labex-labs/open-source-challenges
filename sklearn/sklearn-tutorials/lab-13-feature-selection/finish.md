# Summary

Feature selection is an essential step in machine learning to improve the accuracy and performance of models. In this lab, we covered various techniques such as removing features with low variance, univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, and feature selection using SelectFromModel. These techniques help in selecting the most relevant features and reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, resulting in improved model performance.
