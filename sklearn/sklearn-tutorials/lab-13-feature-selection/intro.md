# Introduction

Feature selection is an important step in machine learning. It involves selecting the most relevant features from a dataset to improve the accuracy and performance of the model. In scikit-learn, the `sklearn.feature_selection` module provides various methods for feature selection and dimensionality reduction.

This lab will guide you through the process of feature selection using scikit-learn. We will cover techniques such as removing features with low variance, univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, and feature selection using SelectFromModel.
