# Summary

Pipelines and composite estimators are powerful tools in scikit-learn for combining transformers and estimators into a single model. They provide convenience, parameter selection, and data safety. Pipelines allow for chaining estimators, nested parameters, and caching transformers. Composite estimators like `TransformedTargetRegressor` and `FeatureUnion` provide transformations and feature combination, respectively. These concepts are essential for building complex machine learning models that preprocess and handle heterogeneous data effectively.
