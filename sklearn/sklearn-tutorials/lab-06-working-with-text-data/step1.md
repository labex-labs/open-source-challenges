# Loading the Text Data

First, we need to load the text data that we will be working with. We will use the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which contains news articles from twenty different topics. To load the dataset, we can use the `fetch_20newsgroups` function from scikit-learn.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

# Load the dataset
categories = ['alt.atheism', 'soc.religion.christian', 'comp.graphics', 'sci.med']
twenty_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', categories=categories, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
```

Now we have loaded the data, and we can explore its structure and content.
