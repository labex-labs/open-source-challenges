# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to work with text data using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will learn how to load text data, preprocess it, extract features, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

> You can write code in `06-working-with-text-data.ipynb`.
