# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to work with text data using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will learn how to load text data, preprocess it, extract features, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

You can open the `06-working-with-text-data.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
