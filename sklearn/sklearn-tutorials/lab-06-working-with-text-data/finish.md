# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to work with text data using scikit-learn. We loaded the text data, preprocessed it, extracted feature vectors, trained a model, and evaluated its performance. Working with text data can be challenging, but scikit-learn provides powerful tools and algorithms to make the process easier.
