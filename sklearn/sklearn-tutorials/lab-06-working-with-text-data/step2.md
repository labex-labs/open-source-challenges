# Preprocessing the Text Data

Before we can use the text data for machine learning, we need to preprocess it. This involves several steps, such as removing punctuation, converting all text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text into individual words. We can perform these preprocessing steps using scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer`.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer

# Preprocess the text data
count_vect = CountVectorizer()
X_train_counts = count_vect.fit_transform(twenty_train.data)

tfidf_transformer = TfidfTransformer()
X_train_tfidf = tfidf_transformer.fit_transform(X_train_counts)
```

Now our text data is preprocessed and ready for feature extraction.
