# Summary

In this lab, we explored various techniques for decomposing signals into their components. We learned about Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). These techniques are widely used in various applications such as dimensionality reduction, blind source separation, topic modeling, and more. By applying these techniques, we can gain insights and extract meaningful information from high-dimensional signals and datasets.
