  "title": "Decomposing Signals in Components",
  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the topic of decomposing signals into components using matrix factorization techniques provided by scikit-learn. We will cover techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and more. This lab will guide you through the process of decomposing signals into their components step by step.",
