# Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

#### ICA for blind source separation

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used to separate mixed signals into their original source components. It assumes that the components are statistically independent and can be extracted through a linear unmixing process. ICA can be implemented using the `FastICA` class from scikit-learn.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import FastICA

# Create an ICA object with n_components as the number of desired components
ica = FastICA(n_components=2)

# Fit the ICA model to the mixed signals
ica.fit(mixed_signals)

# Separate the mixed signals into the original source components
source_components = ica.transform(mixed_signals)
```
