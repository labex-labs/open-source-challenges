# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the topic of decomposing signals into components using matrix factorization techniques provided by scikit-learn. We will cover techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and more. This lab will guide you through the process of decomposing signals into their components step by step.

> You can write code in `22-decomposing-signals-in-components.ipynb`.
