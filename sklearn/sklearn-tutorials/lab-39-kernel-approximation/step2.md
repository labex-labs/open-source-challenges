# Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel Approximation

The RBFSampler class implements an approximate mapping for the RBF kernel, also known as Random Kitchen Sinks. This technique allows us to explicitly model a kernel map before applying a linear algorithm, such as linear SVM or logistic regression.

To use RBFSampler for kernel approximation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the RBFSampler object with the desired value of gamma (the parameter of the RBF kernel) and the number of components.

```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import RBFSampler

gamma = 0.1
n_components = 100
rbf_sampler = RBFSampler(gamma=gamma, n_components=n_components)
```

2. Fit the RBFSampler object to your training data.

```python
rbf_sampler.fit(X_train)
```

3. Transform your training and test data using the RBFSampler object.

```python
X_train_transformed = rbf_sampler.transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = rbf_sampler.transform(X_test)
```
