# Nystroem Method for Kernel Approximation

The Nystroem method is a general technique for approximating kernels using a low-rank approximation. It subsamples the dataset on which the kernel is evaluated. By default, it uses the RBF kernel, but it can be used with any kernel function or a precomputed kernel matrix.

To use the Nystroem method for kernel approximation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the Nystroem object with the desired number of components (i.e., the target dimensionality of the feature transform).

```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem

n_components = 100
nystroem = Nystroem(n_components=n_components)
```

2. Fit the Nystroem object to your training data.

```python
nystroem.fit(X_train)
```

3. Transform your training and test data using the Nystroem object.

```python
X_train_transformed = nystroem.transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = nystroem.transform(X_test)
```
