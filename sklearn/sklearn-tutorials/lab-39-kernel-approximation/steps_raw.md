# Kernel Approximation

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using kernel approximation techniques in scikit-learn.

Kernel methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), are powerful techniques for non-linear classification. These methods rely on the concept of a kernel function that maps input data into a high-dimensional feature space. However, working with explicit feature mappings can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. Kernel approximation methods provide a solution by generating low-dimensional approximations of the kernel feature space.

In this tutorial, we will explore several kernel approximation techniques available in scikit-learn, including the Nystroem method, Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel approximation, Additive Chi Squared (ACS) kernel approximation, Skewed Chi Squared (SCS) kernel approximation, and Polynomial kernel approximation using Tensor Sketch. We will demonstrate how to use these techniques and discuss their advantages and limitations.

## Steps

### Step 1: Nystroem Method for Kernel Approximation

The Nystroem method is a general technique for approximating kernels using a low-rank approximation. It subsamples the dataset on which the kernel is evaluated. By default, it uses the RBF kernel, but it can be used with any kernel function or a precomputed kernel matrix.

To use the Nystroem method for kernel approximation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the Nystroem object with the desired number of components (i.e., the target dimensionality of the feature transform).

```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem

n_components = 100
nystroem = Nystroem(n_components=n_components)
```

2. Fit the Nystroem object to your training data.

```python
nystroem.fit(X_train)
```

3. Transform your training and test data using the Nystroem object.

```python
X_train_transformed = nystroem.transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = nystroem.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 2: Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel Approximation

The RBFSampler class implements an approximate mapping for the RBF kernel, also known as Random Kitchen Sinks. This technique allows us to explicitly model a kernel map before applying a linear algorithm, such as linear SVM or logistic regression.

To use RBFSampler for kernel approximation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the RBFSampler object with the desired value of gamma (the parameter of the RBF kernel) and the number of components.

```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import RBFSampler

gamma = 0.1
n_components = 100
rbf_sampler = RBFSampler(gamma=gamma, n_components=n_components)
```

2. Fit the RBFSampler object to your training data.

```python
rbf_sampler.fit(X_train)
```

3. Transform your training and test data using the RBFSampler object.

```python
X_train_transformed = rbf_sampler.transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = rbf_sampler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 3: Additive Chi Squared (ACS) Kernel Approximation

The ACS kernel is a kernel on histograms, commonly used in computer vision. The AdditiveChi2Sampler class provides an approximate mapping for this kernel.

To use AdditiveChi2Sampler for kernel approximation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the AdditiveChi2Sampler object with the desired number of samples (n) and the regularization parameter (c).

```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import AdditiveChi2Sampler

n_samples = 1000
c = 1.0
additive_chi2_sampler = AdditiveChi2Sampler(n_samples=n_samples, sample_steps=2, sample_interval=2, sample_octave=2, c=c)
```

2. Fit the AdditiveChi2Sampler object to your training data.

```python
additive_chi2_sampler.fit(X_train)
```

3. Transform your training and test data using the AdditiveChi2Sampler object.

```python
X_train_transformed = additive_chi2_sampler.transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = additive_chi2_sampler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 4: Skewed Chi Squared (SCS) Kernel Approximation

The SCS kernel is a variant of the exponentiated chi squared kernel that allows for a simple Monte Carlo approximation of the feature map. The SkewedChi2Sampler class provides an approximate mapping for this kernel.

To use SkewedChi2Sampler for kernel approximation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the SkewedChi2Sampler object with the desired number of samples (n) and the regularization parameter (c).

```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import SkewedChi2Sampler

n_samples = 1000
c = 1.0
skewed_chi2_sampler = SkewedChi2Sampler(n_samples=n_samples, sample_steps=2, sample_interval=2, sample_octave=1, c=c)
```

2. Fit the SkewedChi2Sampler object to your training data.

```python
skewed_chi2_sampler.fit(X_train)
```

3. Transform your training and test data using the SkewedChi2Sampler object.

```python
X_train_transformed = skewed_chi2_sampler.transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = skewed_chi2_sampler.transform(X_test)
```

### Step 5: Polynomial Kernel Approximation via Tensor Sketch

The Polynomial kernel is a popular kernel function that models interactions between features. The PolynomialCountSketch class provides a scalable method for approximating this kernel using the TensorSketch approach.

To use PolynomialCountSketch for kernel approximation, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the PolynomialCountSketch object with the desired degree (d) and the number of components.

```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import PolynomialCountSketch

degree = 3
n_components = 100
polynomial_count_sketch = PolynomialCountSketch(degree=degree, n_components=n_components)
```

2. Fit the PolynomialCountSketch object to your training data.

```python
polynomial_count_sketch.fit(X_train)
```

3. Transform your training and test data using the PolynomialCountSketch object.

```python
X_train_transformed = polynomial_count_sketch.transform(X_train)
X_test_transformed = polynomial_count_sketch.transform(X_test)
```
