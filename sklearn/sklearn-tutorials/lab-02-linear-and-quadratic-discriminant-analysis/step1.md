# Import the required libraries

First, we need to import the required libraries, including scikit-learn (sklearn) and matplotlib, which will be used for data visualization.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis
```
