# Introduction

Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA) are two classic classifiers used in machine learning. LDA uses a linear decision surface, while QDA uses a quadratic decision surface. These classifiers are popular because they have closed-form solutions, work well in practice, and have no hyperparameters to tune.

In this lab, we will explore how to perform LDA and QDA using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.
