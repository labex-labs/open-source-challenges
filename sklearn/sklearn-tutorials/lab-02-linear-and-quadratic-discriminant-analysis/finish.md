# Summary

Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA) are two classic classifiers used in machine learning. LDA uses a linear decision surface, while QDA uses a quadratic decision surface. These classifiers have closed-form solutions and perform well in practice. LDA can also be used for supervised dimensionality reduction.
