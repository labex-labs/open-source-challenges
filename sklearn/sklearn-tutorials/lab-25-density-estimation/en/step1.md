# Import the necessary libraries

First, we need to import the libraries that we will be using for density estimation. We will use the `KernelDensity` estimator from the `sklearn.neighbors` module, and the `numpy` library for data manipulation.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KernelDensity
import numpy as np
```
