# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to perform kernel density estimation using the `KernelDensity` estimator from scikit-learn. Kernel density estimation is a powerful technique for estimating the probability density function of a random variable. By fitting a kernel density estimator to a dataset, we can estimate the underlying density and visualize it using a histogram and the estimated density function. This allows us to gain insights into the distribution of the data and make probabilistic predictions.
