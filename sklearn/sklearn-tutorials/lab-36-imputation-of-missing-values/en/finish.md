# Summary

In this tutorial, we learned different strategies for imputing missing values using scikit-learn. We explored univariate feature imputation with `SimpleImputer`, multivariate feature imputation with `IterativeImputer`, nearest neighbors imputation with `KNNImputer`, keeping the number of features constant, and marking imputed values with `MissingIndicator`. These techniques can be valuable tools for handling missing data and ensuring that machine learning algorithms can be applied to incomplete datasets.
