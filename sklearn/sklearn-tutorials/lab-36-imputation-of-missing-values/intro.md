# Introduction

Many real-world datasets contain missing values, which can cause issues when using machine learning algorithms that assume complete and numerical data. In such cases, it is important to handle missing values appropriately to make the most of the available data. One common strategy is imputation, which involves filling in the missing values based on the known part of the data.

In this tutorial, we will explore different strategies for imputing missing values using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.
