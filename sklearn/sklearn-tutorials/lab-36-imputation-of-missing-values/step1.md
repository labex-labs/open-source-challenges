# Import the necessary modules

First, we need to import the required modules from the scikit-learn library. We will use the `SimpleImputer` class for univariate feature imputation and the `IterativeImputer` class for multivariate feature imputation.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer, IterativeImputer
```
