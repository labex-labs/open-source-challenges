# Introduction

In machine learning, it is important to evaluate the quality of the predictions made by a model. This helps us understand how well the model is performing and whether it can be trusted for making accurate predictions. The scikit-learn library provides several metrics and scoring methods to quantify the quality of predictions.

In this lab, we will explore three different APIs provided by scikit-learn for model evaluation: the Estimator score method, the scoring parameter, and the metric functions.
