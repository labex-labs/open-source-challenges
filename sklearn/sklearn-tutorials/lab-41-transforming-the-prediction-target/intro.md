# Introduction

In machine learning, it is often necessary to transform the prediction target before training a model. This can include tasks such as converting multiclass labels into a binary indicator matrix or encoding non-numerical labels into numerical labels.

In this lab, we will explore the various techniques provided by the `sklearn.preprocessing` module in scikit-learn to transform the prediction target.
