# Interpret the Results

Based on the accuracy obtained, we can interpret the performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the iris dataset. The accuracy represents the proportion of correctly predicted target variable values in the test set. In this case, the accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified iris flower species.
