# Summary

In this lab, we went through an example of using the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier from scikit-learn. We loaded the iris dataset, split it into training and test sets, trained the classifier on the training set, and evaluated its performance on the test set. The accuracy obtained gives us an indication of how well the classifier performed in predicting the species of iris flowers. Naive Bayes classifiers are simple yet effective algorithms for classification tasks and are commonly used in various real-world applications.
