# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and its implementation using the scikit-learn library in Python. KRR combines ridge regression with the kernel trick to learn a linear function in the space induced by the kernel. It is a non-linear regression method that can handle non-linear relationships between input and output variables.
