# Summary

In this lab, we learned about Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and how to implement it using the scikit-learn library in Python. We generated synthetic data, fit a KRR model to the data, visualized the predicted function, and optimized the hyperparameters using grid search. KRR is a powerful non-linear regression method that can handle complex relationships between variables.
