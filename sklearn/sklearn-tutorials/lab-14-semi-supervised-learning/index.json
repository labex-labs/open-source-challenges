  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the concept of semi-supervised learning, which is a type of machine learning where some of the training data is labeled and some is unlabeled. Semi-supervised learning algorithms can leverage the unlabeled data to improve the model's performance and generalize better to new samples. This is particularly useful when we have a small amount of labeled data but a large amount of unlabeled data.",
