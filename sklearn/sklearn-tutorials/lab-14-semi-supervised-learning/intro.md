# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of semi-supervised learning, which is a type of machine learning where some of the training data is labeled and some is unlabeled. Semi-supervised learning algorithms can leverage the unlabeled data to improve the model's performance and generalize better to new samples. This is particularly useful when we have a small amount of labeled data but a large amount of unlabeled data.

In this lab, we will focus on two semi-supervised learning algorithms: Self Training and Label Propagation. We will learn how to implement and use these algorithms using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.
