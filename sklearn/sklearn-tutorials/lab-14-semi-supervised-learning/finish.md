# Summary

Semi-supervised learning is a powerful technique that allows us to leverage unlabeled data to improve the performance of our models. In this lab, we learned about two semi-supervised learning algorithms: Self Training and Label Propagation. We also learned how to implement and use these algorithms using scikit-learn. By incorporating unlabeled data into our machine learning workflows, we can make better use of the available data and achieve more accurate predictions.
