# Introduction

Welcome to **Installation**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, you will need to install Rust using `rustup`, a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools, by downloading it through an internet connection.
