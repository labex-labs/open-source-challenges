# Updating and Uninstalling

Once Rust is installed via `rustup`, updating to a newly released version is easy. From your shell, run the following update script:

```bash
rustup update
```

To uninstall Rust and `rustup`, run the following uninstall script from your shell:

```bash
rustup self uninstall
```

Enter `N` when prompted to confirm that you want to uninstall Rust.
