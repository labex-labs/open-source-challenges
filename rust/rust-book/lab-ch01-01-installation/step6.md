# Local Documentation

The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so
that you can read it offline. Run `rustup doc` to open the local documentation
in your browser.

Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and youâ€™re not
sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface
(API) documentation to find out!
