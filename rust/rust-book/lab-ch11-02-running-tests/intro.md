# Introduction

Welcome to **Controlling How Tests Are Run**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, you will learn how to control the behavior of test runs in Rust using command line options for `cargo test` and the resultant test binary.
