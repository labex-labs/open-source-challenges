# Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements

Like any other `struct`, a vector is freed when it goes out of scope, as
annotated in Listing 8-10.

```
{
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

    // do stuff with v
} // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here
```

Listing 8-10: Showing where the vector and its elements are dropped

When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning the
integers it holds will be cleaned up. The borrow checker ensures that any
references to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is
valid.

Letâ€™s move on to the next collection type: `String`!
