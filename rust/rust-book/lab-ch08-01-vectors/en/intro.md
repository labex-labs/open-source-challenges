# Introduction

Welcome to **Storing Lists of Values With Vectors**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

"In this lab, we will explore the `Vec<T>` collection type, also known as a vector, which allows for storing lists of values of the same type in a single data structure."
