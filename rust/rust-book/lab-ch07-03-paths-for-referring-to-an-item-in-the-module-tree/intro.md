# Introduction

Welcome to **Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we learn that paths are used in Rust to refer to items in the module tree, and can take the form of absolute paths or relative paths.
