# Printing Values with println! Placeholders

Aside from the closing curly bracket, there's only one more line to discuss in the code so far:

```rust
println!("You guessed: {guess}");
```

This line prints the string that now contains the user's input. The `{}` set of curly brackets is a placeholder: think of `{}` as little crab pincers that hold a value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can go inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an expression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the format string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty curly bracket placeholder in the same order. Printing a variable and the result of an expression in one call to `println!` would look like this:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
```

This code would print `x = 5 and y = 12`.
