# Introduction

Welcome to **Programming a Guessing Game**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will be implementing a guessing game in Rust, where the program generates a random number and prompts the player to guess it, providing feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high, and congratulating the player if they guess correctly.
