# Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping

The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. We’ll add a loop to give users
more chances at guessing the number:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
--snip--

println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");

loop {
    println!("Please input your guess.");

    --snip--

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

As you can see, we’ve moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into
a loop. Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each
and run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever,
which actually introduces a new problem. It doesn’t seem like the user can quit!

The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut
ctrl-C. But there’s another way to escape this insatiable monster, as mentioned
in the `parse` discussion in “Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number” on page
XX: if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We can take
advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 59
Please input your guess.
45
You guessed: 45
Too small!
Please input your guess.
60
You guessed: 60
Too big!
Please input your guess.
59
You guessed: 59
You win!
Please input your guess.
quit
thread 'main' panicked at 'Please type a number!: ParseIntError
{ kind: InvalidDigit }', src/main.rs:28:47
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

Typing `quit` will quit the game, but as you’ll notice, so will entering any
other non-number input. This is suboptimal, to say the least; we want the game
to also stop when the correct number is guessed.
