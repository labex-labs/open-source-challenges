# Generating a Secret Number

Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The secret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more than once. We'll use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn't too difficult. Rust doesn't yet include random number functionality in its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a `rand` crate at *https://crates.io/crates/rand* with said functionality.
