# Introduction

Welcome to **Processing a Series of Items With Iterators**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore how to process a series of items using iterators, which are lazy and allow us to iterate over a sequence of items without having to reimplement the logic ourselves.
