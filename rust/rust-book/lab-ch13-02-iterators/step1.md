# Processing a Series of Items with Iterators

The iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items in turn. An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you don't have to reimplement that logic yourself.

In Rust, iterators are _lazy_, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that consume the iterator to use it up. For example, the code in Listing 13-10 creates an iterator over the items in the vector `v1` by calling the `iter` method defined on `Vec<T>`. This code by itself doesn't do anything useful.

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v1_iter = v1.iter();
```

Listing 13-10: Creating an iterator

The iterator is stored in the `v1_iter` variable. Once we've created an iterator, we can use it in a variety of ways. In Listing 3-5, we iterated over an array using a `for` loop to execute some code on each of its items. Under the hood, this implicitly created and then consumed an iterator, but we glossed over how exactly that works until now.

In the example in Listing 13-11, we separate the creation of the iterator from the use of the iterator in the `for` loop. When the `for` loop is called using the iterator in `v1_iter`, each element in the iterator is used in one iteration of the loop, which prints out each value.

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v1_iter = v1.iter();

for val in v1_iter {
    println!("Got: {val}");
}
```

Listing 13-11: Using an iterator in a `for` loop

In languages that don't have iterators provided by their standard libraries, you would likely write this same functionality by starting a variable at index 0, using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, and incrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached the total number of items in the vector.

Iterators handle all of that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code you could potentially mess up. Iterators give you more flexibility to use the same logic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures you can index into, like vectors. Let's examine how iterators do that.
