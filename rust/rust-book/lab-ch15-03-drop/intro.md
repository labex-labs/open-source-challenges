# Introduction

Welcome to **Running Code on Cleanup With the Drop Trait**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we explore the `Drop` trait in Rust, which allows for customization of cleanup actions when a value goes out of scope, typically used in smart pointers, and can be implemented by providing a `drop` method that is automatically called by Rust, avoiding the need for explicit cleanup code.
