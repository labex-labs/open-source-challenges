# The Character Type

Rust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type. Here are
some examples of declaring `char` values:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
```

Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string
literals, which use double quotes. Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and
represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than
just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji;
and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. Unicode Scalar
Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive.
However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human
intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a `char` is in
Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in “Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with
Strings” on page XX.
