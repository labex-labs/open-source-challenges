# Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain _data type_, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. We'll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

Keep in mind that Rust is a _statically typed_ language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases when many types are possible, such as when we converted a `String` to a numeric type using `parse` in "Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number" on page XX, we must add a type annotation, like this:

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

If we don't add the `: u32` type annotation shown in the preceding code, Rust will display the following error, which means the compiler needs more information from us to know which type we want to use:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling no_type_annotations v0.1.0 (file:///projects/no_type_annotations)
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> src/main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |         ^^^^^ consider giving `guess` a type
```

You'll see different type annotations for other data types.
