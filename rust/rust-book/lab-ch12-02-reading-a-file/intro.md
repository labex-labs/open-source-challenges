# Introduction

Welcome to **Reading a File**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we add functionality to read the file specified in the `file_path` argument by using the `fs::read_to_string` method, and then print the contents of the file.
