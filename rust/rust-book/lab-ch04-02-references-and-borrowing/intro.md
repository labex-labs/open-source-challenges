# Introduction

Welcome to **References and Borrowing**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we learn how to use references in Rust to borrow values rather than taking ownership, allowing us to pass and manipulate data without needing to return ownership back to the calling function.
