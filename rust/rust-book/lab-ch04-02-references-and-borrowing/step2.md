# Mutable References

We can fix the code from Listing 4-6 to allow us to modify a borrowed value with just a few small tweaks that use, instead, a _mutable reference_:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

First we change `s` to be `mut`. Then we create a mutable reference with `&mut s` where we call the `change` function, and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with `some_string: &mut String`. This makes it very clear that the `change` function will mutate the value it borrows.

Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value. This code that attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{r1}, {r2}");
```

Here's the error:

```bash
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:5:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |              ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 |
7 |     println!("{r1}, {r2}");
  |                -- first borrow later used here
```

This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time. The first mutable borrow is in `r1` and must last until it's used in the `println!`, but between the creation of that mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference in `r2` that borrows the same data as `r1`.

The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It's something that new Rustaceans struggle with because most languages let you mutate whenever you'd like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A _data race_ is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix when you're trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races!

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems

let r2 = &mut s;
```

Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references. This code results in an error:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

println!("{r1}, {r2}, and {r3}");
```

Here's the error:

```bash
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as
immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &s; // no problem
  |              -- immutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &s; // no problem
6 |     let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
  |              ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 |     println!("{r1}, {r2}, and {r3}");
  |                -- immutable borrow later used here
```

Whew! We _also_ cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.

Users of an immutable reference don't expect the value to suddenly change out from under them! However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else's reading of the data.

Note that a reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable references, the `println!`, occurs before the mutable reference is introduced:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
println!("{r1} and {r2}");
// variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
println!("{r3}");
```

The scopes of the immutable references `r1` and `r2` end after the `println!` where they are last used, which is before the mutable reference `r3` is created. These scopes don't overlap, so this code is allowed: the compiler can tell that the reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope.

Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it's the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then you don't have to track down why your data isn't what you thought it was.
