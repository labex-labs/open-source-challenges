# References and Borrowing

The issue with the tuple code in Listing 4-5 is that we have to return the `String` to the calling function so we can still use the `String` after the call to `calculate_length`, because the `String` was moved into `calculate_length`. Instead, we can provide a reference to the `String` value. A _reference_ is like a pointer in that it's an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.

Here is how you would define and use a `calculate_length` function that has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass `&s1` into `calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than `String`. These ampersands represent _references_, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-5 depicts this concept.

Figure 4-5: A diagram of `&String s` pointing at `String s1`

> Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is _dereferencing_, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`. We'll see some uses of the dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in Chapter 15.

Let's take a closer look at the function call here:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");

let len = calculate_length(&s1);
```

The `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that _refers_ to the value of `s1` but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.

Likewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of the parameter `s` is a reference. Let's add some explanatory annotations:

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, the String is not dropped
```

The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function parameter's scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped when `s` stops being used, because `s` doesn't have ownership. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won't need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you're done, you have to give it back. You don't own it.

So, what happens if we try to modify something we're borrowing? Try the code in Listing 4-6. Spoiler alert: it doesn't work!

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

Listing 4-6: Attempting to modify a borrowed value

Here's the error:

```bash
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*some_string` as mutable, as it is behind a `&`
reference
 --> src/main.rs:8:5
  |
7 | fn change(some_string: &String) {
  |                        ------- help: consider changing this to be a mutable
reference: `&mut String`
8 |     some_string.push_str(", world");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `some_string` is a `&` reference, so
the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
```

Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We're not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.
