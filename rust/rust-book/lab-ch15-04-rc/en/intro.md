# Introduction

Welcome to **Rc<T>, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will be exploring the use of Rc<T> (reference counting) in Rust for enabling multiple owners of a value by tracking the number of references to the value and ensuring it is only cleaned up when there are no owners.
