# Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops

If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost
loop at that point. You can optionally specify a _loop label_ on a loop that
you can then use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords
apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin
with a single quote. Here’s an example with two nested loops:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```

The outer loop has the label `'counting_up`, and it will count up from 0 to 2.
The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first `break` that
doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The `break
'counting_up;` statement will exit the outer loop. This code prints:

End count = 2
```
