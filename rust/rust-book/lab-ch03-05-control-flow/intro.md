# Introduction

Welcome to **Control Flow**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will be focusing on control flow in Rust, which involves using if expressions and loops to run code based on conditions and to repeat code while a condition is true.
