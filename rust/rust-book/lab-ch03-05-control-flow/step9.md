# Conditional Loops with while

A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the
condition is `true`, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be `true`, the
program calls `break`, stopping the loop. It’s possible to implement behavior
like this using a combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`; you could
try that now in a program, if you’d like. However, this pattern is so common
that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a `while` loop. In
Listing 3-3, we use `while` to loop the program three times, counting down each
time, and then, after the loop, print a message and exit.

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

Listing 3-3: Using a `while` loop to run code while a condition evaluates to
`true`

This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used
`loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and it’s clearer. While a condition
evaluates to `true`, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.
