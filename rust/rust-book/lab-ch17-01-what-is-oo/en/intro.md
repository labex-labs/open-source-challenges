# Introduction

Welcome to **Characteristics of Object-Oriented Languages**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore the characteristics of object-oriented languages, including objects, encapsulation, and inheritance, and examine whether Rust supports these features.
