# Introduction

Welcome to **Closures: Anonymous Functions That Capture Their Environment**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, you will explore closures in Rust, which are anonymous functions that can be saved in variables or passed as arguments, allowing for code reuse and behavior customization by capturing values from their defining scope.
