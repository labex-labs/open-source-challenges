# Capturing the Environment with Closures

We'll first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the environment they're defined in for later use. Here's the scenario: every so often, our T-shirt company gives away an exclusive, limited-edition shirt to someone on our mailing list as a promotion. People on the mailing list can optionally add their favorite color to their profile. If the person chosen for a free shirt has their favorite color set, they get that color shirt. If the person hasn't specified a favorite color, they get whatever color the company currently has the most of.

There are many ways to implement this. For this example, we're going to use an enum called `ShirtColor` that has the variants `Red` and `Blue` (limiting the number of colors available for simplicity). We represent the company's inventory with an `Inventory` struct that has a field named `shirts` that contains a `Vec<ShirtColor>` representing the shirt colors currently in stock. The method `giveaway` defined on `Inventory` gets the optional shirt color preference of the free-shirt winner, and returns the shirt color the person will get. This setup is shown in Listing 13-1.

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Copy, Clone)]
enum ShirtColor {
    Red,
    Blue,
}

struct Inventory {
    shirts: Vec<ShirtColor>,
}

impl Inventory {
    fn giveaway(
        &self,
        user_preference: Option<ShirtColor>,
    ) -> ShirtColor {
      1 user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())
    }

    fn most_stocked(&self) -> ShirtColor {
        let mut num_red = 0;
        let mut num_blue = 0;

        for color in &self.shirts {
            match color {
                ShirtColor::Red => num_red += 1,
                ShirtColor::Blue => num_blue += 1,
            }
        }
        if num_red > num_blue {
            ShirtColor::Red
        } else {
            ShirtColor::Blue
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let store = Inventory {
      2 shirts: vec![
            ShirtColor::Blue,
            ShirtColor::Red,
            ShirtColor::Blue,
        ],
    };

    let user_pref1 = Some(ShirtColor::Red);
  3 let giveaway1 = store.giveaway(user_pref1);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref1, giveaway1
    );

    let user_pref2 = None;
  4 let giveaway2 = store.giveaway(user_pref2);
    println!(
        "The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}",
        user_pref2, giveaway2
    );
}
```

Listing 13-1: Shirt company giveaway situation

The `store` defined in `main` has two blue shirts and one red shirt remaining to distribute for this limited-edition promotion \[2\]. We call the `giveaway` method for a user with a preference for a red shirt \[3\] and a user without any preference \[4\].

Again, this code could be implemented in many ways, and here, to focus on closures, we've stuck to concepts you've already learned, except for the body of the `giveaway` method that uses a closure. In the `giveaway` method, we get the user preference as a parameter of type `Option<ShirtColor>` and call the `unwrap_or_else` method on `user_preference` \[1\]. The `unwrap_or_else` method on `Option<T>` is defined by the standard library. It takes one argument: a closure without any arguments that returns a value `T` (the same type stored in the `Some` variant of the `Option<T>`, in this case `ShirtColor`). If the `Option<T>` is the `Some` variant, `unwrap_or_else` returns the value from within the `Some`. If the `Option<T>` is the `None` variant, `unwrap_or_else` calls the closure and returns the value returned by the closure.

We specify the closure expression `|| self.most_stocked()` as the argument to `unwrap_or_else`. This is a closure that takes no parameters itself (if the closure had parameters, they would appear between the two vertical pipes). The body of the closure calls `self.most_stocked()`. We're defining the closure here, and the implementation of `unwrap_or_else` will evaluate the closure later if the result is needed.

Running this code prints the following:

```rust
The user with preference Some(Red) gets Red
The user with preference None gets Blue
```

One interesting aspect here is that we've passed a closure that calls `self.most_stocked()` on the current `Inventory` instance. The standard library didn't need to know anything about the `Inventory` or `ShirtColor` types we defined, or the logic we want to use in this scenario. The closure captures an immutable reference to the `self` `Inventory` instance and passes it with the code we specify to the `unwrap_or_else` method. Functions, on the other hand, are not able to capture their environment in this way.
