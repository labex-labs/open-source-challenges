# Introduction

Welcome to **Defining and Instantiating Structs**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we learn about defining and instantiating structs in Rust, where structs hold multiple related values and can have named fields, allowing for more flexible use and access of data.
