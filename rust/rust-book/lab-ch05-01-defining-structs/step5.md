# Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields

You can also define structs that don't have any fields! These are called _unit-like structs_ because they behave similarly to `()`, the unit type that we mentioned in "The Tuple Type" on page XX. Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don't have any data that you want to store in the type itself. We'll discuss traits in Chapter 10. Here's an example of declaring and instantiating a unit struct named `AlwaysEqual`:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```

To define `AlwaysEqual`, we use the `struct` keyword, the name we want, and then a semicolon. No need for curly brackets or parentheses! Then we can get an instance of `AlwaysEqual` in the `subject` variable in a similar way: using the name we defined, without any curly brackets or parentheses. Imagine that later we'll implement behavior for this type such that every instance of `AlwaysEqual` is always equal to every instance of any other type, perhaps to have a known result for testing purposes. We wouldn't need any data to implement that behavior! You'll see in Chapter 10 how to define traits and implement them on any type, including unit-like structs.

> **Ownership of Struct Data**
>
> In the `User` struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned `String` type rather than the `&str` string slice type. This is a deliberate choice because we want each instance of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.

> It's also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of _lifetimes_, a Rust feature that we'll discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is. Let's say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like the following in `src/main.rs`; this won't work:
>
>     struct User {
>         active: bool,
>         username: &str,
>         email: &str,
>         sign_in_count: u64,
>     }
>
>     fn main() {
>         let user1 = User {
>             active: true,
>             username: "someusername123",
>             email: "someone@example.com",
>             sign_in_count: 1,
>         };
>     }

> In Chapter 10, we'll discuss how to fix these errors so you can store references in structs, but for now, we'll fix errors like these using owned types like `String` instead of references like `&str`.
