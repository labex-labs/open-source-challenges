# Introduction

Welcome to **Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will implement a graceful shutdown and cleanup mechanism in our code by utilizing the `Drop` trait and providing a way for threads to stop accepting new requests and shut down.
