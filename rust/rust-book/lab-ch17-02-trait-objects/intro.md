Welcome to **Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore how to use trait objects to allow for values of different types in a library, specifically in the context of a graphical user interface (GUI) tool.
