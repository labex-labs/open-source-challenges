# Parameters

We can define functions to have _parameters_, which are special variables that are part of a function's signature. When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values are called _arguments_, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words _parameter_ and _argument_ interchangeably for either the variables in a function's definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.

In this version of `another_function` we add a parameter:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

Try running this program; you should get the following output:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
```

The declaration of `another_function` has one parameter named `x`. The type of `x` is specified as `i32`. When we pass `5` in to `another_function`, the `println!` macro puts `5` where the pair of curly brackets containing `x` was in the format string.

In function signatures, you _must_ declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust's design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give more helpful error messages if it knows what types the function expects.

When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}
```

This example creates a function named `print_labeled_measurement` with two parameters. The first parameter is named `value` and is an `i32`. The second is named `unit_label` and is type `char`. The function then prints text containing both the `value` and the `unit_label`.

Let's try running this code. Replace the program currently in your _functions_ project's `src/main.rs` file with the preceding example and run it using `cargo run`:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The measurement is: 5h
```

Because we called the function with `5` as the value for `value` and `'h'` as the value for `unit_label`, the program output contains those values.
