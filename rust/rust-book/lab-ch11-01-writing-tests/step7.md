# Using Result<T, E> in Tests

Our tests so far all panic when they fail. We can also write tests that use
`Result<T, E>`! Here’s the test from Listing 11-1, rewritten to use `Result<T,
E>` and return an `Err` instead of panicking:

Filename: `src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() -> Result<(), String> {
        if 2 + 2 == 4 {
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))
        }
    }
}
```

The `it_works` function now has the `Result<(), String>` return type. In the
body of the function, rather than calling the `assert_eq!` macro, we return
`Ok(())` when the test passes and an `Err` with a `String` inside when the test
fails.

Writing tests so they return a `Result<T, E>` enables you to use the question
mark operator in the body of tests, which can be a convenient way to write
tests that should fail if any operation within them returns an `Err` variant.

You can’t use the `#[should_panic]` annotation on tests that use `Result<T,
E>`. To assert that an operation returns an `Err` variant, _don’t_ use the
question mark operator on the `Result<T, E>` value. Instead, use
`assert!(value.is_err())`.

Now that you know several ways to write tests, let’s look at what is happening
when we run our tests and explore the different options we can use with `cargo
test`.
