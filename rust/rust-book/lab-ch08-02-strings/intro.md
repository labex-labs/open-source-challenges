# Introduction

Welcome to **Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text With Strings**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will discuss the complexities of strings in Rust, particularly in relation to UTF-8 encoding, as well as the operations and differences of the String type compared to other collections.
