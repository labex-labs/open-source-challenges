# Strings Are Not So Simple

To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make
different choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer. Rust
has chosen to make the correct handling of `String` data the default behavior
for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into
handling UTF-8 data up front. This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of
strings than is apparent in other programming languages, but it prevents you
from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your
development life cycle.

The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality built
off the `String` and `&str` types to help handle these complex situations
correctly. Be sure to check out the documentation for useful methods like
`contains` for searching in a string and `replace` for substituting parts of a
string with another string.

Letâ€™s switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!
