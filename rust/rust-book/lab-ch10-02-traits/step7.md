# Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the + Syntax

We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted `notify` to use
display formatting as well as `summarize` on `item`: we specify in the `notify`
definition that `item` must implement both `Display` and `Summary`. We can do
so using the `+` syntax:

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {
```

The `+` syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
```

With the two trait bounds specified, the body of `notify` can call `summarize`
and use `{}` to format `item`.
