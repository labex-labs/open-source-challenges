# Introduction

Welcome to **Traits: Defining Shared Behavior**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we explore traits as a way to define shared behavior in a type and to specify trait bounds for generic types.
