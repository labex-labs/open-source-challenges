# Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

A _trait_ defines the functionality a particular type has and can share with
other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We
can use _trait bounds_ to specify that a generic type can be any type that has
certain behavior.

> Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called _interfaces_ in other
> languages, although with some differences.
