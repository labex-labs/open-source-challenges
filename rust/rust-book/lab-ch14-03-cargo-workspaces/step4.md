# Depending on an External Package in a Workspace

Notice that the workspace has only one _Cargo.lock_ file at the top level, rather than having a _Cargo.lock_ in each crate's directory. This ensures that all crates are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the `rand` package to the _adder/Cargo.toml_ and _add_one/Cargo.toml_ files, Cargo will resolve both of those to one version of `rand` and record that in the one _Cargo.lock_. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies means the crates will always be compatible with each other. Let's add the `rand` crate to the `[dependencies]` section in the _add_one/Cargo.toml_ file so we can use the `rand` crate in the `add_one` crate:

Filename: `add_one/Cargo.toml`

```tomlrust
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

We can now add `use rand;` to the `add_one/src/lib.rs` file, and building the whole workspace by running `cargo build` in the `add` directory will bring in and compile the `rand` crate. We will get one warning because we aren't referring to the `rand` we brought into scope:

```bash
$ cargo build
    Updating crates.io index
  Downloaded rand v0.8.5
   --snip--
   Compiling rand v0.8.5
   Compiling add_one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add_one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 10.18s
```

The top-level _Cargo.lock_ now contains information about the dependency of `add_one` on `rand`. However, even though `rand` is used somewhere in the workspace, we can't use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add `rand` to their `Cargo.toml` files as well. For example, if we add `use rand;` to the `adder/src/main.rs` file for the `adder` package, we'll get an error:

```bash
$ cargo build
   --snip--
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rand`
 --> adder/src/main.rs:2:5
  |
2 | use rand;
  |     ^^^^ no external crate `rand`
```

To fix this, edit the `Cargo.toml` file for the `adder` package and indicate that `rand` is a dependency for it as well. Building the `adder` package will add `rand` to the list of dependencies for `adder` in _Cargo.lock_, but no additional copies of `rand` will be downloaded. Cargo has ensured that every crate in every package in the workspace using the `rand` package will be using the same version, saving us space and ensuring that the crates in the workspace will be compatible with each other.
