# Introduction

Welcome to **Separating Modules Into Different Files**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, you will learn how to separate modules into different files by extracting them into their own files and organizing them in a module tree structure.
