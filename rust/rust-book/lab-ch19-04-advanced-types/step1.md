# Advanced Types

The Rust type system has some features that we’ve so far mentioned but haven’t
yet discussed. We’ll start by discussing newtypes in general as we examine why
newtypes are useful as types. Then we’ll move on to type aliases, a feature
similar to newtypes but with slightly different semantics. We’ll also discuss
the `!` type and dynamically sized types.
