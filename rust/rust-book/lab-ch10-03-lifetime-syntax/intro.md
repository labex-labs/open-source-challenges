# Introduction

Welcome to **Validating References With Lifetimes**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will discuss lifetimes and how they ensure that references are valid as long as needed, and although lifetimes may feel unfamiliar, we will cover common ways you might encounter lifetime syntax to help you get comfortable with the concept.
