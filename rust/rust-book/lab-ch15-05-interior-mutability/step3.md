# Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable Value

A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when you have an immutable value, you can't borrow it mutably. For example, this code won't compile:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &mut x;
}
```

If you tried to compile this code, you'd get the following error:

```bash
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `x` as mutable, as it is not declared
as mutable
 --> src/main.rs:3:13
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - help: consider changing this to be mutable: `mut x`
3 |     let y = &mut x;
  |             ^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
```

However, there are situations in which it would be useful for a value to mutate itself in its methods but appear immutable to other code. Code outside the value's methods would not be able to mutate the value. Using `RefCell<T>` is one way to get the ability to have interior mutability, but `RefCell<T>` doesn't get around the borrowing rules completely: the borrow checker in the compiler allows this interior mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked at runtime instead. If you violate the rules, you'll get a `panic!` instead of a compiler error.

Let's work through a practical example where we can use `RefCell<T>` to mutate an immutable value and see why that is useful.
