# Accepting Command Line Arguments

Let's create a new project with, as always, `cargo new`. We'll call our project `minigrep` to distinguish it from the `grep` tool that you might already have on your system.

```bash
$ cargo new minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep
```

The first task is to make `minigrep` accept its two command line arguments: the file path and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able to run our program with `cargo run`, two hyphens to indicate the following arguments are for our program rather than for `cargo`, a string to search for, and a path to a file to search in, like so:

```bash
cargo run -- searchstring example-filename.txt
```

Right now, the program generated by `cargo new` cannot process arguments we give it. Some existing libraries on *https://crates.io* can help with writing a program that accepts command line arguments, but because you're just learning this concept, let's implement this capability ourselves.
