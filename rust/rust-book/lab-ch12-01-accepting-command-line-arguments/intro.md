# Introduction

Welcome to **Accepting Command Line Arguments**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will create a new project called "minigrep" that accepts two command line arguments: a string to search for and a file path.
