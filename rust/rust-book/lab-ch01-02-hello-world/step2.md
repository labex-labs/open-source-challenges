# Creating a Project Directory

You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter
to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this book,
we suggest making a `projects` directory in your home directory and keeping all
your projects there.

Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a `projects` directory
and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the `projects` directory.

For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:

```bash
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
```

For Windows CMD, enter this:

```
> mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> mkdir hello_world
> cd hello_world
```
