# Creating a Project Directory

You'll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn't matter to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this book, we suggest making a `project` directory in your home directory and keeping all your projects there.

Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a `project` directory and a directory for the "Hello, world!" project within the `project` directory.

For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:

```bash
cd ~/project
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
```
