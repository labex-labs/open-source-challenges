# Hello, World

Now that you've installed Rust, it's time to write your first Rust program. It's traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints the text `Hello, world!` to the screen, so we'll do the same here!

> Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust makes no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so if you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) instead of the command line, feel free to use your favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the IDE's documentation for details. The Rust team has been focusing on enabling great IDE support via `rust-analyzer`. See Appendix D for more details.
