# Introduction

Welcome to **An Example Program Using Structs**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will write a program using structs to calculate the area of a rectangle, refactoring the initial code that used separate variables for width and height.
