# Introduction

Welcome to **Publishing a Crate to Crates**.io. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will discuss how to publish a crate to crates.io, the crate registry that distributes open source code, making it easier for people to find and use your package.
