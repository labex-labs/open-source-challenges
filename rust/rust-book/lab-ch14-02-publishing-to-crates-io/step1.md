# Publishing a Crate to Crates.io

We’ve used packages from *https://crates.io* as dependencies of our project,
but you can also share your code with other people by publishing your own
packages. The crate registry at *https://crates.io* distributes the source code
of your packages, so it primarily hosts code that is open source.

Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for people
to find and use. We’ll talk about some of these features next and then explain
how to publish a package.
