# Creating a Safe Abstraction over Unsafe Code

Just because a function contains unsafe code doesn’t mean we need to mark the
entire function as unsafe. In fact, wrapping unsafe code in a safe function is
a common abstraction. As an example, let’s study the `split_at_mut` function
from the standard library, which requires some unsafe code. We’ll explore how
we might implement it. This safe method is defined on mutable slices: it takes
one slice and makes it two by splitting the slice at the index given as an
argument. Listing 19-4 shows how to use `split_at_mut`.

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

let r = &mut v[..];

let (a, b) = r.split_at_mut(3);

assert_eq!(a, &mut [1, 2, 3]);
assert_eq!(b, &mut [4, 5, 6]);
```

Listing 19-4: Using the safe `split_at_mut` function

We can’t implement this function using only safe Rust. An attempt might look
something like Listing 19-5, which won’t compile. For simplicity, we’ll
implement `split_at_mut` as a function rather than a method and only for slices
of `i32` values rather than for a generic type `T`.

```rust
fn split_at_mut(
    values: &mut [i32],
    mid: usize,
) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
    let len = values.len();

    assert!(mid <= len);

    (&mut values[..mid], &mut values[mid..])
}
```

Listing 19-5: An attempted implementation of `split_at_mut` using only safe Rust

This function first gets the total length of the slice. Then it asserts that
the index given as a parameter is within the slice by checking whether it’s
less than or equal to the length. The assertion means that if we pass an index
that is greater than the length to split the slice at, the function will panic
before it attempts to use that index.

Then we return two mutable slices in a tuple: one from the start of the
original slice to the `mid` index and another from `mid` to the end of the
slice.

When we try to compile the code in Listing 19-5, we’ll get an error:

```bash
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `*values` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:9:31
  |
2 |     values: &mut [i32],
  |             - let's call the lifetime of this reference `'1`
...
9 |     (&mut values[..mid], &mut values[mid..])
  |     --------------------------^^^^^^--------
  |     |     |                   |
  |     |     |                   second mutable borrow occurs here
  |     |     first mutable borrow occurs here
  |     returning this value requires that `*values` is borrowed for `'1`
```

Rust’s borrow checker can’t understand that we’re borrowing different parts of
the slice; it only knows that we’re borrowing from the same slice twice.
Borrowing different parts of a slice is fundamentally okay because the two
slices aren’t overlapping, but Rust isn’t smart enough to know this. When we
know code is okay, but Rust doesn’t, it’s time to reach for unsafe code.

Listing 19-6 shows how to use an `unsafe` block, a raw pointer, and some calls
to unsafe functions to make the implementation of `split_at_mut` work.

```rust
use std::slice;

fn split_at_mut(
    values: &mut [i32],
    mid: usize,
) -> (&mut [i32], &mut [i32]) {
  1 let len = values.len();
  2 let ptr = values.as_mut_ptr();

  3 assert!(mid <= len);

  4 unsafe {
        (
          5 slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
          6 slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.add(mid), len - mid),
        )
    }
}
```

Listing 19-6: Using unsafe code in the implementation of the `split_at_mut`
function

Recall from “The Slice Type” on page XX that a slice is a pointer to some data
and the length of the slice. We use the `len` method to get the length of a
slice [1] and the `as_mut_ptr` method to access the raw pointer of a slice [2].
In this case, because we have a mutable slice to `i32` values, `as_mut_ptr`
returns a raw pointer with the type `*mut i32`, which we’ve stored in the
variable `ptr`.

We keep the assertion that the `mid` index is within the slice [3]. Then we get
to the unsafe code [4]: the `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` function takes a raw
pointer and a length, and it creates a slice. We use it to create a slice that
starts from `ptr` and is `mid` items long [5]. Then we call the `add` method on
`ptr` with `mid` as an argument to get a raw pointer that starts at `mid`, and
we create a slice using that pointer and the remaining number of items after
`mid` as the length [6].

The function `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` is unsafe because it takes a raw
pointer and must trust that this pointer is valid. The `add` method on raw
pointers is also unsafe because it must trust that the offset location is also
a valid pointer. Therefore, we had to put an `unsafe` block around our calls to
`slice::from_raw_parts_mut` and `add` so we could call them. By looking at the
code and by adding the assertion that `mid` must be less than or equal to
`len`, we can tell that all the raw pointers used within the `unsafe` block
will be valid pointers to data within the slice. This is an acceptable and
appropriate use of `unsafe`.

Note that we don’t need to mark the resultant `split_at_mut` function as
`unsafe`, and we can call this function from safe Rust. We’ve created a safe
abstraction to the unsafe code with an implementation of the function that uses
`unsafe` code in a safe way, because it creates only valid pointers from the
data this function has access to.

In contrast, the use of `slice::from_raw_parts_mut` in Listing 19-7 would
likely crash when the slice is used. This code takes an arbitrary memory
location and creates a slice 10,000 items long.

```rust
use std::slice;

let address = 0x01234usize;
let r = address as *mut i32;

let values: &[i32] = unsafe {
    slice::from_raw_parts_mut(r, 10000)
};
```

Listing 19-7: Creating a slice from an arbitrary memory location

We don’t own the memory at this arbitrary location, and there is no guarantee
that the slice this code creates contains valid `i32` values. Attempting to use
`values` as though it’s a valid slice results in undefined behavior.
