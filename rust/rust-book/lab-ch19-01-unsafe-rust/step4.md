# Calling an Unsafe Function or Method

The second type of operation you can perform in an unsafe block is calling unsafe functions. Unsafe functions and methods look exactly like regular functions and methods, but they have an extra `unsafe` before the rest of the definition. The `unsafe` keyword in this context indicates the function has requirements we need to uphold when we call this function, because Rust can't guarantee we've met these requirements. By calling an unsafe function within an `unsafe` block, we're saying that we've read this function's documentation and we take responsibility for upholding the function's contracts.

Here is an unsafe function named `dangerous` that doesn't do anything in its body:

    unsafe fn dangerous() {}

    unsafe {
        dangerous();
    }

We must call the `dangerous` function within a separate `unsafe` block. If we try to call `dangerous` without the `unsafe` block, we'll get an error:

```bash
error[E0133]: call to unsafe function is unsafe and requires
unsafe function or block
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
4 |     dangerous();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ call to unsafe function
  |
  = note: consult the function's documentation for information on
how to avoid undefined behavior
```

With the `unsafe` block, we're asserting to Rust that we've read the function's documentation, we understand how to use it properly, and we've verified that we're fulfilling the contract of the function.

Bodies of unsafe functions are effectively `unsafe` blocks, so to perform other unsafe operations within an unsafe function, we don't need to add another `unsafe` block.
