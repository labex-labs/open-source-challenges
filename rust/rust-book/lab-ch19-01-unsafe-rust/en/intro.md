# Introduction

Welcome to **Unsafe Rust**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will explore unsafe Rust, a feature that allows us to bypass the memory safety guarantees enforced at compile time and gives us extra superpowers, while also understanding the risks and responsibilities involved in using it.
