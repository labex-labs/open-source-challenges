# Alternatives to Using match with Result\<T, E\>

That's a lot of `match`! The `match` expression is very useful but also very much a primitive. In Chapter 13, you'll learn about closures, which are used with many of the methods defined on `Result<T, E>`. These methods can be more concise than using `match` when handling `Result<T, E>` values in your code.

For example, here's another way to write the same logic as shown in Listing 9-5, this time using closures and the `unwrap_or_else` method:

    // src/main.rs
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::ErrorKind;

    fn main() {
        let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
            if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
                File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                    panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", error);
                })
            } else {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", error);
            }
        });
    }

Although this code has the same behavior as Listing 9-5, it doesn't contain any `match` expressions and is cleaner to read. Come back to this example after you've read Chapter 13, and look up the `unwrap_or_else` method in the standard library documentation. Many more of these methods can clean up huge nested `match` expressions when you're dealing with errors.
