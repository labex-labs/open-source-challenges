# Introduction

Welcome to **Recoverable Errors With Result**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we learn how to handle recoverable errors with the `Result` enum in Rust, which allows us to interpret and respond to errors without terminating the program.
