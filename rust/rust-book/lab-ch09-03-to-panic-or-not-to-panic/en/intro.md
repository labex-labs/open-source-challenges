# Introduction

Welcome to **To Panic or Not to Panic**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, the decision of whether to call `panic!` or return a `Result` depends on the recoverability of the error situation and the options available to the calling code.
