# Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests

When you're writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including robust error-handling code can make the example less clear. In examples, it's understood that a call to a method like `unwrap` that could panic is meant as a placeholder for the way you'd want your application to handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.

Similarly, the `unwrap` and `expect` methods are very handy when prototyping, before you're ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in your code for when you're ready to make your program more robust.

If a method call fails in a test, you'd want the whole test to fail, even if that method isn't the functionality under test. Because `panic!` is how a test is marked as a failure, calling `unwrap` or `expect` is exactly what should happen.
