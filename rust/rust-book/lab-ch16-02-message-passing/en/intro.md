# Introduction

Welcome to **Using Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we explore message passing as a safe concurrency approach, using channels in Rust's standard library to send and receive data between threads.
