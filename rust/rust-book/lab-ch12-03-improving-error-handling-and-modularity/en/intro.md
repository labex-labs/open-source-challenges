# Introduction

Welcome to **Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will refactor the program to improve modularity and error handling by separating tasks, grouping configuration variables, providing meaningful error messages, and consolidating error-handling code.
