# Introduction

Welcome to **Packages and Crates**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will cover packages and crates, where a crate is the smallest unit of code that the Rust compiler considers and can be a binary crate or a library crate, and a package is a collection of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality.
