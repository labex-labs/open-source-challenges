Welcome to **Hello, Cargo**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will learn about Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager, which simplifies tasks such as code building, dependency management, and library downloading for Rust projects.
