# Cargo as Convention

With simple projects, Cargo doesn't provide a lot of value over just using `rustc`, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate. Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it's much easier to let Cargo coordinate the build.

Even though the `hello_cargo` project is simple, it now uses much of the real tooling you'll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code using Git, change to that project's directory, and build:

```bash
git clone example.org/someproject
cd someproject
cargo build
```
