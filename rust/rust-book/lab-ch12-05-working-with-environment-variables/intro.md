# Introduction

Welcome to **Working With Environment Variables**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will be enhancing `minigrep` by allowing users to enable case-insensitive searching via an environment variable, providing a convenient way to apply this feature to all their searches in a terminal session.
