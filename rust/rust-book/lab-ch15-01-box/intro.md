# Introduction

Welcome to **Using Box<T> to Point to Data on the Heap**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will learn about using Box<T> smart pointers to store data on the heap, rather than the stack, in situations where the size of the type is unknown at compile time, when transferring ownership of large amounts of data to avoid copying, or when owning a value that implements a particular trait.
