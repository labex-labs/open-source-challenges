# Introduction

Welcome to **What Is Ownership?**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, you will learn about ownership in Rust, a set of rules that govern how a program manages memory, and how it affects the behavior and performance of the language.
