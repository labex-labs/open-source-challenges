# Stack-Only Data: Copy

There's another wrinkle we haven't talked about yet. This code using integers---part of which was shown in Listing 4-2---works and is valid:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {x}, y = {y}");
```

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don't have a call to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn't moved into `y`.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make. That means there's no reason we would want to prevent `x` from being valid after we create the variable `y`. In other words, there's no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn't do anything different from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we'll talk more about traits in Chapter 10). If a type implements the `Copy` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

Rust won't let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type, we'll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the `Copy` annotation to your type to implement the trait, see "Derivable Traits" on page XX.

So, what types implement the `Copy` trait? You can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement `Copy`. Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:

- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating-point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.
