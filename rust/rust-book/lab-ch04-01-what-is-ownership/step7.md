# Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

If we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`. We'll discuss method syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many programming languages, you've probably seen them before.

Here's an example of the `clone` method in action:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");
```

This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3, where the heap data _does_ get copied.

When you see a call to `clone`, you know that some arbitrary code is being executed and that code may be expensive. It's a visual indicator that something different is going on.
