# Introduction

Welcome to **Test Organization**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will learn about the two main categories of tests in the Rust community: unit tests, which are small and focused on testing individual modules in isolation, and integration tests, which use the public interface of the library and potentially exercise multiple modules per test.
