# Introduction

Welcome to **Concise Control Flow With if Let**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we explore the concise control flow of the `if let` syntax, which allows for combining `if` and `let` in a shorter and more readable way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.
