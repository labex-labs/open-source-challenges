Welcome to **Turning Our Single-Threaded Server Into a Multithreaded Server**. This lab is a part of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can practice your Rust skills in LabEx.

In this lab, we will be transforming our single-threaded server into a multithreaded server to improve its efficiency in processing multiple requests simultaneously.
