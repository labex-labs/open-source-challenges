# Hashing Functions

By default, `HashMap` uses a hashing function called _SipHash_ that can provide resistance to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involving hash tables. This is not the fastest hashing algorithm available, but the trade-off for better security that comes with the drop in performance is worth it. If you profile your code and find that the default hash function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another function by specifying a different hasher. A _hasher_ is a type that implements the `BuildHasher` trait. We'll talk about traits and how to implement them in Chapter 10. You don't necessarily have to implement your own hasher from scratch; *https://crates.io* has libraries shared by other Rust users that provide hashers implementing many common hashing algorithms.
