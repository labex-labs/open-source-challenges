# Overwriting a Value

If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced. Even though the code in Listing 8-23 calls `insert` twice, the hash map will only contain one key--value pair because we're inserting the value for the Blue team's key both times.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

Listing 8-23: Replacing a value stored with a particular key

This code will print `{"Blue": 25}`. The original value of `10` has been overwritten.
