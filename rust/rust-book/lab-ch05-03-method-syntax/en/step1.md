# Method Syntax

_Methods_ are similar to functions: we declare them with the `fn` keyword and a name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code that's run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in Chapter 6 and Chapter 17, respectively), and their first parameter is always `self`, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
