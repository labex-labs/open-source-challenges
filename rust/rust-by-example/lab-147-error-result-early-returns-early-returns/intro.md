# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the concept of early returns as a way to handle errors in Rust. The example code demonstrates how we can use match statements and early returns to handle errors gracefully, making the code easier to read and write. We also discuss the limitations of explicit error handling and introduce the use of the `?` operator for cases where we need to unwrap values without risking a panic.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
