# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to destructure tuples in Rust using the `match` statement. The example code demonstrates different patterns for destructuring tuples, such as extracting specific elements, ignoring certain elements, and using the wildcard `_` to indicate that the value doesn't matter.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
