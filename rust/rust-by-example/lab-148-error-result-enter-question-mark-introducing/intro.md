# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the `?` operator in Rust, which allows us to simplify error handling by returning `Err` instead of panicking, and we will also explore the `try!` macro, which achieved similar functionality before `?` was introduced.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
