# Introduction

In this lab, it is explained that the `?` operator in Rust can be used to automatically convert errors into the desired return type, eliminating the need for explicit error handling using `map_err`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
