  "title": "Rust RAII Resource Management",
  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the concept of RAII in Rust, which enforces resource acquisition is initialization. This means that when objects go out of scope, their destructors are called and their owned resources are freed, eliminating the need for manual memory management and ensuring protection against resource leak bugs. We will also learn about the Drop trait in Rust, which allows custom destructor logic to be implemented for types that require it.",
