# Introduction

In this lab, the `and_then()` combinator is introduced as a chainable alternative to `map()` when working with `Option<T>`, as it avoids nesting `Option<Option<T>>` and simplifies code readability.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
