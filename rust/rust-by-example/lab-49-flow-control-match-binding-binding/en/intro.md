# Introduction

In this lab, the concept of binding in Rust is explored, which allows for indirect access to variables and the ability to branch and use that variable without re-binding. The `@` sigil in the `match` statement is used for binding values to names. Examples are provided, including how to bind values to a specific range and how to "destructure" `enum` variants like `Option`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
