# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the concept of elision in Rust, where the borrow checker allows the omission of common lifetime patterns to improve readability and reduce typing.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
