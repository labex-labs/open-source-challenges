  "title": "Derive Traits in Rust Tuple Structs",
  "description": "In this lab, we learn about the #[derive] attribute in Rust, which allows the compiler to provide basic implementations for certain traits such as Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Clone, Copy, Hash, Default, and Debug. These traits can also be manually implemented if a more complex behavior is needed. The lab provides example code showcasing the usage of these traits on different tuple structs such as Centimeters, Inches, and Seconds.",
