# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about the `#[derive]` attribute in Rust, which allows the compiler to provide basic implementations for certain traits such as `Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Clone`, `Copy`, `Hash`, `Default`, and `Debug`. These traits can also be manually implemented if a more complex behavior is needed. The lab provides example code showcasing the usage of these traits on different tuple structs such as `Centimeters`, `Inches`, and `Seconds`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
