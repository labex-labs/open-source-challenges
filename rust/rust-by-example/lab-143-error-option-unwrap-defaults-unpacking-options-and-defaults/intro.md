# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore different ways to unpack an `Option` and fall back on a default value if it is `None`, considering factors such as eager or lazy evaluation and whether to modify the empty value in place or keep it intact.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
