# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about child processes in Rust using the `process::Output` struct to represent the output of a finished child process and the `process::Command` struct to build processes. The example code demonstrates how to execute the `rustc --version` command and handle the output accordingly by checking if the process succeeded or failed.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
