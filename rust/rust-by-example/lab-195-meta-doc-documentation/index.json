  "description": "In this lab, you can use cargo doc to build documentation in target/doc. You can also use cargo test to run all tests, including documentation tests, and cargo test --doc to only run documentation tests. Doc comments, denoted by ///, are compiled into documentation by rustdoc and support Markdown. These comments are useful for documenting code in big projects. Doc attributes, such as inline, no_inline, and hidden, are frequently used with rustdoc. Rustdoc is widely used by the community for generating documentation, including the standard library docs.",
