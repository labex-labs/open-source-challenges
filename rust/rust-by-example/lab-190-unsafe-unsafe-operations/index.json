  "description": "In this lab, we will explore unsafe operations in Rust, which are used to bypass compiler protections and are typically used for dereferencing raw pointers, calling unsafe functions, accessing or modifying static mutable variables, and implementing unsafe traits. These operations should be minimized in a code base to ensure safety.",
