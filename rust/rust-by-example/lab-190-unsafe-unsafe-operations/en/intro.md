# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore unsafe operations in Rust, which are used to bypass compiler protections and are typically used for dereferencing raw pointers, calling unsafe functions, accessing or modifying static mutable variables, and implementing unsafe traits. These operations should be minimized in a code base to ensure safety.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
