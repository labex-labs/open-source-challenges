# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the usage of the `super` and `self` keywords in Rust for removing ambiguity and avoiding hardcoded paths when accessing items.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
