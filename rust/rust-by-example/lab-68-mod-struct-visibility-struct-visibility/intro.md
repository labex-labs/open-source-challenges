# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about the visibility of structs in Rust and how it affects the accessibility of their fields.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
