# Introduction

In this lab, the code demonstrates how to use the `Box` type to preserve original errors by wrapping them, allowing for dynamic error handling, and the `Std` library's `From` trait helps in converting any type that implements the `Error` trait into the trait object `Box<Error>`. It includes an example of converting and handling errors using `Box` with a custom error type.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
