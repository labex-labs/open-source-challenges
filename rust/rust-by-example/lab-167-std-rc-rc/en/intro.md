# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the usage of `Rc` (Reference Counting) in Rust which allows for managing ownership of a value by keeping track of the number of references.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
