# Introduction

In this lab, we are introduced to the concept of constants in Rust, which can be declared using either `const` or `static` keywords, with explicit type annotations, and can be accessed in any scope, including the global scope.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
