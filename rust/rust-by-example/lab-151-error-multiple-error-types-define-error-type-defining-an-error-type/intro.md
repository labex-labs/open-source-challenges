# Introduction

In this lab, we are looking at how to define a custom error type in Rust and the key characteristics that make a good error type, such as representing different errors with the same type, providing clear error messages, easy comparison with other types, and the ability to hold information about the error. We also examine an example code that demonstrates the implementation of a custom error type and its usage in error handling scenarios.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
