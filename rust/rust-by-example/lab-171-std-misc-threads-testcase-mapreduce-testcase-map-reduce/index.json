  "title": "Parallel Data Processing in Rust",
  "description": "In this lab, the Rust programming language is explored for its ability to parallelize data processing using a map-reduce algorithm. The example code calculates the sum of all digits in a block of numbers by dividing the data into segments and processing each segment in a separate thread. The Rust standard library provides threading primitives that prevent data races and guarantee thread safety. The program also demonstrates Rust's understanding of passing read-only references across thread boundaries. Additionally, the code showcases the use of closures, iterators, and the join() method to combine the intermediate results of each thread into a final sum. To ensure efficiency, the program can be modified to chunk the data into a limited number of segments, rather than depending on user-inputted data that may lead to an excessive number of threads.",
