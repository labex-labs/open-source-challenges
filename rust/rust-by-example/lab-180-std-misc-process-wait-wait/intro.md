# Introduction

In this lab, you can learn how to wait for a `process::Child` to finish by calling `Child::wait`, which will return a `process::ExitStatus`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
