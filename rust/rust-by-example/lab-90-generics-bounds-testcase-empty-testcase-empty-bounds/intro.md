# Introduction

In this lab, the code showcases how traits can be used as bounds, even if the traits do not include any functionality, by using the `Eq` and `Copy` traits as examples.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
