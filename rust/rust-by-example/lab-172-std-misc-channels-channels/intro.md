# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about Rust's asynchronous channels, which allow unidirectional communication between threads using the `Sender` and `Receiver` endpoints, as demonstrated in the provided Rust code snippet.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
