# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the importance of testing in software development using Rust and how to write different types of tests such as unit tests and integration tests. We will also learn about organizing tests in Rust projects and running them using the `cargo test` command. Additionally, we will discuss the potential issues that can arise from running tests concurrently and provide an example to illustrate this.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
