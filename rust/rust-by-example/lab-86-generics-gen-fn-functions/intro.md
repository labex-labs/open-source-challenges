# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to define generic functions in Rust. To make a function generic, you need to prepend the type `T` with `<T>`. Sometimes, you may need to explicitly specify type parameters while calling a generic function, which can be done using the syntax `fun::<A, B, ...>()`. The code provided demonstrates the usage of generic functions in Rust and includes examples of functions that are both generic and non-generic.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
