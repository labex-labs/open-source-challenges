# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about enums in Rust, which allow the creation of a type that can have multiple variants, including unit-like, tuple structs, and c-like structures. We also see how to define enum variants and use pattern matching to handle different variants. Additionally, we explore type aliases, which provide a way to refer to each enum variant via an alias, making the code more concise and readable.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
