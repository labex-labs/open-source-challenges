# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about using macros with the `+` and `*` symbols in the argument list to indicate repetition. Specifically, the example provided demonstrates how to use `$(...),+` to match one or more expressions separated by commas. The macro, `find_min!`, calculates the minimum value among a variable number of arguments.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
