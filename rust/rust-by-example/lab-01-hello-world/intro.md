# Introduction

In this lab, we have the source code for the traditional Hello World program written in Rust. The code consists of a main function that contains a println! macro, which prints the text "Hello World!" to the console. To generate a binary executable, the code can be compiled using the Rust compiler, rustc. Running the compiled binary will display the message "Hello World!". The activity in the lab involves adding a new line with a second println! macro to display the additional message "I'm a Rustacean!" in the output.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
