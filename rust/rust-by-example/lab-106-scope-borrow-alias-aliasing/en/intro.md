# Introduction

In this lab, the concept of aliasing is explored in the context of Rust programming language. Aliasing refers to the situation where multiple references are created to the same data, either as immutable or mutable borrows.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
