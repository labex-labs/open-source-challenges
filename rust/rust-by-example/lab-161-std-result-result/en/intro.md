# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the `Result` enum in Rust, which allows us to express the success or failure of an operation by returning either `Ok` with a value or `Err` with an explanation of the failure.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
