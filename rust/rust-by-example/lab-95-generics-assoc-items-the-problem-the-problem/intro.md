# Introduction

In this lab, we have a trait called `Contains` that is generic over its container type and requires explicit specification of its generic types when implemented for the `Container` type.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
