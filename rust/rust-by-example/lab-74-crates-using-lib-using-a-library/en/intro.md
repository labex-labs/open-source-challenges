# Introduction

In this lab, to link a crate to a new library in Rust, you can use the `rustc` command's `--extern` flag and import all of its items under a module with the same name as the library.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
