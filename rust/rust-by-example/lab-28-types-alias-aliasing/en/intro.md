# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about aliasing in Rust, which allows us to give a new name to an existing type using the `type` statement. Aliases must follow certain naming conventions, and can be used to create new names for primitive types or user-defined types. The main purpose of aliases is to reduce code duplication and improve readability.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
