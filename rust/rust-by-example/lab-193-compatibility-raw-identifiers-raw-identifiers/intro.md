# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about raw identifiers in Rust, which allow us to use keywords as identifiers in situations where they are typically not allowed, such as variable or function names, especially when older editions of Rust clash with newer keywords.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
