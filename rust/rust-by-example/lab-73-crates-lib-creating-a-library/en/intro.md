# Introduction

In this lab, we will create a library called `rary` in Rust. The `rary` library contains a public function called `public_function`, a private function called `private_function`, and an indirect access function called `indirect_access`. Afterwards, we compile the library using the `rustc` command, resulting in a file named `library.rlib`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
