# Introduction

In this lab, the `use` declaration is used to eliminate the need for manual scoping in Rust and make names available without explicitly specifying the namespace.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
