# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the use of literals and operators in Rust. Literals such as integers, floats, characters, strings, booleans, and the unit type can be expressed using their literal forms. Integers can also be expressed in hexadecimal, octal, or binary notation. Underscores can be used to improve readability in numeric literals. Rust supports scientific E-notation for float literals. Operators such as addition, subtraction, logical operations, bitwise operations, and shift operations are available in Rust.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
