  "title": "Using Rust Match Guards",
  "description": "In this lab, we learn about using match guards in Rust to filter arms based on conditions. The match guard is added after the pattern and is represented by the if keyword followed by a condition. The guard condition allows us to further refine the matching of patterns and perform additional checks before executing the corresponding arm of the match expression. However, it is important to note that the compiler does not consider guard conditions when checking pattern coverage, so it's necessary to ensure that all patterns are still covered by the match expression.",
