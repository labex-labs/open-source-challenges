# Introduction

In this lab, the compiler provides a `dead_code` lint that warns about unused functions, but you can use attributes, such as `#[allow(dead_code)]`, to disable the lint and prevent the warnings.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
