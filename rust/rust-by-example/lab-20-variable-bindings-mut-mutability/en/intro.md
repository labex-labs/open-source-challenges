# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about mutability in Rust and how variable bindings can be made mutable using the `mut` modifier. The lab includes an example of declaring immutable and mutable bindings, demonstrating how a mutable binding can be modified, and highlighting the error when trying to assign a new value to an immutable variable.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
