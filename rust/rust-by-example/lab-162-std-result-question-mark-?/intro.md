# Introduction

In this lab, the `?` operator is introduced as a way to make code cleaner when chaining results. It is used at the end of an expression returning a `Result` and simplifies the code by automatically handling the `Err` and `Ok` branches. The example provided demonstrates how to use the `?` operator in Rust to handle various math operations and their potential errors.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
