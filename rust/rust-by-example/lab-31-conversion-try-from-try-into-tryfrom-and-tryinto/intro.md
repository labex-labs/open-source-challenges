# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the usage of `TryFrom` and `TryInto` in Rust, which are generic traits used for fallible conversions between types and return `Result` types. We provide an example code snippet that demonstrates the implementation of `TryFrom` for converting an `i32` into a custom `EvenNumber` struct, and then showcase how to use `TryFrom` and `TryInto` to perform the conversion and handle the possible errors.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
