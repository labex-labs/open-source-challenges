# Introduction

In this lab, the mutability of data is demonstrated through Rust programming language by showcasing how ownership and mutability can be changed when a box is moved from an immutable state to a mutable state.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
