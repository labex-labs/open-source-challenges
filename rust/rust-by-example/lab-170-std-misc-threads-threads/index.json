  "description": "In this lab, we have a code snippet in Rust that demonstrates how to spawn native OS threads using the spawn function and a moving closure. The code creates a vector to hold the spawned threads, iterates through a range of numbers to spawn multiple threads, and prints a message identifying each thread number. Finally, the main thread waits for each spawned thread to finish using the join function.",
