# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the usage of the `if let` construct in Rust, which allows for cleaner code when matching enums and provides the ability to specify failure options. We also demonstrate how `if let` can be used to match any enum value, including non-parameterized variants. Additionally, we provide an example of fixing code that attempts to compare two enum values by using `if let` instead.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
