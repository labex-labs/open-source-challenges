# Introduction

In this lab, it is explained that closures in Rust use type anonymity, which requires the usage of generics when using closures as function parameters.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
