# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the `Option<T>` enum in Rust, which provides two variants (`None` and `Some(value)`) to handle failure or lack of value in a program.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
