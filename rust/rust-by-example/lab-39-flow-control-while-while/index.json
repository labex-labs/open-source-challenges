  "title": "Rust FizzBuzz Loop Programming",
  "description": "In this lab, we learn about the while keyword, which is used to create a loop that continues executing as long as a specified condition is true. To illustrate its usage, we write a program in Rust called FizzBuzz. The program uses a while loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 (i.e., a multiple of 15) and prints \"fizzbuzz\" in such cases. If the number is only divisible by 3, it prints \"fizz\", and if it is only divisible by 5, it prints \"buzz\". For all other numbers, it simply prints the number itself. The loop continues until the counter variable reaches 101, incrementing it after printing each number or label.",
