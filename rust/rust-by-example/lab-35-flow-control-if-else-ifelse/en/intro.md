# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about using `if`-`else` statements in Rust. Similar to other programming languages, `if`-`else` statements in Rust don't require parentheses around the condition and each condition is followed by a block of code. These conditionals are expressions, so all branches must return the same type. Within the code example provided, we first check if the variable `n` is less than 0, and if so, it prints that `n` is negative. If `n` is not less than 0, we then check if it is greater than 0 and print that `n` is positive. Finally, if none of the previous conditions are met, we print that `n` is zero. Another example demonstrates how the `if`-`else` statement can be used as an expression to assign a new value to the variable `big_n`. If `n` is between -10 and 10, it prints that `n` is a small number and assigns `10 * n` to `big_n`. Otherwise, it prints that `n` is a big number and assigns `n / 2` to `big_n`. The final output of `n` and `big_n` is printed at the end.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
