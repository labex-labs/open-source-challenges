  "description": "In this lab, we learn about using if-else statements in Rust. Similar to other programming languages, if-else statements in Rust don't require parentheses around the condition and each condition is followed by a block of code. These conditionals are expressions, so all branches must return the same type. Within the code example provided, we first check if the variable n is less than 0, and if so, it prints that n is negative. If n is not less than 0, we then check if it is greater than 0 and print that n is positive. Finally, if none of the previous conditions are met, we print that n is zero. Another example demonstrates how the if-else statement can be used as an expression to assign a new value to the variable big_n. If n is between -10 and 10, it prints that n is a small number and assigns 10 * n to big_n. Otherwise, it prints that n is a big number and assigns n / 2 to big_n. The final output of n and big_n is printed at the end.",
