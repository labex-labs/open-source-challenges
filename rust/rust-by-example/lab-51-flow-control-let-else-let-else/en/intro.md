# Introduction

In this lab, the use of `let`-`else` in Rust is demonstrated, where a refutable pattern can match and bind variables in the surrounding scope, or else diverge when the pattern doesn't match by using statements like `break`, `return`, or `panic!`. This construct allows for concise and readable code when dealing with pattern matching and error handling scenarios, eliminating the need for repeating code blocks or using outer `let` statements.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
