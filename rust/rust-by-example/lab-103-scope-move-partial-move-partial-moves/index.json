  "title": "Partial Move Destructuring in Rust",
  "description": "In this lab, we learn about partial moves within the destructuring of a single variable, where both by-move and by-reference pattern bindings can be used simultaneously. This results in a partial move of the variable, allowing some parts to be moved while others can still be referenced. If a parent variable is partially moved, it cannot be used as a whole afterwards, but the parts that are only referenced and not moved can still be used.",
