# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about destructuring `structs` in Rust, which allows you to extract individual fields and their values from a struct using pattern matching.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
