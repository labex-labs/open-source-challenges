# Introduction

In this lab, the usage of `std::Child` struct to represent a running child process and its interaction through pipes with the `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` handles is demonstrated.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
