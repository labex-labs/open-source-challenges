  "description": "In this lab, we learn about using for loops and ranges in Rust. We can use the for loop along with the range notation a..b to iterate through a range of values. For example, we can write the FizzBuzz program using a for loop instead of a while loop. Additionally, we can use the ..= notation for a range that is inclusive on both ends. The for loop can also interact with iterators in different ways, such as using iter to borrow each element of a collection, into_iter to consume the collection, or iter_mut to mutably borrow each element of the collection. Each of these methods provides a different view of the data within the collection, allowing for different actions to be performed.",
