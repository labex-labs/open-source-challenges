# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to implement the `fmt::Display` trait in Rust to customize the output appearance of a structure. You will also explore the difference between `fmt::Display` and `fmt::Debug`, as well as the limitations of `fmt::Display` for generic container types. Finally, you will have an activity to implement the `fmt::Display` trait for a new `Complex` struct and print it in a specific format.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
