# Introduction

In this lab, we have a C-like example in Rust that demonstrates how to use `enum` as C-like enums, including enums with implicit and explicit discriminators.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
