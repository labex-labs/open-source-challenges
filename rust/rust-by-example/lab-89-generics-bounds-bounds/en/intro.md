# Introduction

In this lab, when working with generics in Rust, type parameters must be bounded by traits to specify the functionality a type must implement.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
