# Introduction

In this lab, the concept of coercion in Rust is explored, where a longer lifetime can be coerced into a shorter one to enable functionality within a specific scope. This can occur through inferred coercion by the Rust compiler or by declaring a lifetime difference using syntax such as `<'a: 'b, 'b>`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
