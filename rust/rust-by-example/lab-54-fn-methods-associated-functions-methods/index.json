  "description": "In this lab, we define a Point struct with associated functions origin() and new(), and a Rectangle struct with methods area(), perimeter(), and translate(). We also introduce a Pair struct with a method destroy(). We demonstrate how to use these functions and methods by creating instances of the structs and calling the respective functions and methods on them.",
