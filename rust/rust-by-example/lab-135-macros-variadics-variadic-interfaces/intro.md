# Introduction

In this lab, we explore variadic interfaces, which are interfaces that can take an arbitrary number of arguments. As an example, we modify the `calculate!` macro from the previous section to be variadic, allowing it to evaluate multiple expressions at once.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
