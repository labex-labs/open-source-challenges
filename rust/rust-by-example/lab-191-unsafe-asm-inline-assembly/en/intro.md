# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the usage of inline assembly in Rust using the `asm!` macro. We will cover the basic usage of inline assembly, inputs and outputs, late output operands, explicit register operands, clobbered registers, symbol operands and ABI clobbers, register template modifiers, memory address operands, labels, and options for optimizing the assembly code.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
