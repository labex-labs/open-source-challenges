# Introduction

In this lab, we explore higher-order functions (HOFs) in Rust, which are functions that take one or more functions and/or produce a more useful function, and how they can be used in combination with lazy iterators to give Rust a functional flavor.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
