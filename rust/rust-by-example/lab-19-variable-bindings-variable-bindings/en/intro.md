# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about variable bindings in Rust, where values can be assigned to variables using the `let` binding, and how type annotations can be used but are often inferred by the compiler.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
