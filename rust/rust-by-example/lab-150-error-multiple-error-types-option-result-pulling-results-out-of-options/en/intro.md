# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to handle mixed error types by embedding them within each other using `Option` and `Result` types in Rust.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
