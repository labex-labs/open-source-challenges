# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about the `Iterator::find` function in Rust, which iterates over an iterator and searches for the first value that satisfies a given condition. If none of the values satisfy the condition, it returns `None`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
