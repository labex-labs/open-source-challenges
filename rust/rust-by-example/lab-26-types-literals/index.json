  "description": "In this lab, we learn about literals in Rust and how to specify their types by adding a suffix. Suffixed literals have their types known at initialization, while unsuffixed literals' types depend on how they are used. The size_of_val function is used to determine the size of a variable in bytes, and it is called with its full path, std::mem::size_of_val. The size_of_val function is defined in the mem module, which is in turn defined in the std crate.",
