# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `use` declaration in Rust, which allows us to bind a full path to a new name for easier access, and can be used with the `as` keyword to bind imports to a different name. Example code snippets demonstrate how to use the `use` declaration to simplify accessing functions and modules within nested paths.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
