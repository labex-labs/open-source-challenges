# Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about the concept of returning from loops in Rust, which involves retrying an operation until it succeeds and passing the resulting value to the rest of the code by placing it after the `break` statement within the `loop` expression.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
