# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the use of the `Drop` trait in Rust, which is called automatically when an object goes out of scope and is used to free the resources that the object owns.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
