# Introduction

In this lab, we explore different strategies for handling the possibility of failures while iterating over a collection of `Result`s in Rust.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
