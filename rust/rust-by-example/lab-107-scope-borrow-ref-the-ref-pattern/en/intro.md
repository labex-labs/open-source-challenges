# Introduction

In this lab, the 'ref' keyword is explored, which is used in pattern matching or destructuring via the 'let' binding to take references to the fields of a struct/tuple in Rust programming language.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
