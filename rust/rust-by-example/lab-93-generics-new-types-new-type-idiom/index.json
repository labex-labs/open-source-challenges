  "description": "In this lab, we explore the newtype idiom, which provides compile-time guarantees by allowing us to create a new type that is distinct from its underlying type. An example is shown where a struct Years is used to represent age in years, and a struct Days is used to represent age in days. By using the newtype idiom, we can ensure that the right type of value is supplied to a program, such as in the age verification function old_enough, which requires a value of type Years. Additionally, we learn how to obtain the value of a newtype as its underlying type using tuple or destructuring syntax.",
