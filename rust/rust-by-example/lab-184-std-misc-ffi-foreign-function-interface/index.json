  "title": "Foreign Function Interface",
  "description": "In this lab, we learn about Rust's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that allows interaction with C libraries by declaring foreign functions within an extern block and annotating them with a #[link] attribute containing the name of the foreign library. The code example demonstrates the usage of FFI to call external functions from the libm library, such as computing the square root of a single precision complex number and calculating the cosine of a complex number. Safe wrappers are commonly used around these unsafe foreign function calls. The lab also includes a minimal implementation of single precision complex numbers and demonstrates how to call safe APIs wrapped around unsafe operations.",
