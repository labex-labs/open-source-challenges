# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about nesting and labeling loops in Rust, where we can use the `break` and `continue` statements to terminate or skip outer loops within nested loops by annotating loops with labels.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
