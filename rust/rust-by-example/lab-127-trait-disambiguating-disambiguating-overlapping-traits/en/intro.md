# Introduction

In this lab, the issue of disambiguating overlapping traits is discussed, where two traits have methods with the same name and potentially different return types.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
