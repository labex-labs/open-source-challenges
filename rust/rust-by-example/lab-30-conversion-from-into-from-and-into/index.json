  "description": "In this lab, we explore the concepts of From and Into traits in Rust, which are used for converting between different types. These traits are inherently linked, with Into being the reciprocal of From. The From trait allows a type to define how to create itself from another type, enabling easy conversion between types. The Into trait automatically calls the From implementation when necessary. Both traits can be implemented for custom types, providing flexibility in type conversions.",
