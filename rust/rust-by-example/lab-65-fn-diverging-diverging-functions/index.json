  "description": "In this lab, we learn about diverging functions that are marked using ! in Rust. Diverging functions never return and their return type is an empty type. This is different from the () type which has only one possible value. Diverging functions can be useful when casting to any other type is required, such as in match branches. They are also the return type of functions that loop forever or terminate the process.",
