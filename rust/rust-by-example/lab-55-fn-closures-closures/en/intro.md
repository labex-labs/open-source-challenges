# Introduction

In this lab, we explore closures, which are functions in Rust that can capture the enclosing environment by referring to variables outside their scope.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
