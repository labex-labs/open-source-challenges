# Introduction

In this lab, the `Iterator::any` function is discussed, which is a function that takes an iterator as input and returns `true` if any element in the iterator satisfies a given predicate, and `false` otherwise. The function is defined as a trait method in Rust's standard library and can be used on any type that implements the `Iterator` trait. The function takes a closure as an argument, which determines the predicate to be applied to each element in the iterator. The closure is defined with the `FnMut` trait, meaning that it can modify captured variables but not consume them. The `any` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the predicate is satisfied by any element in the iterator.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
