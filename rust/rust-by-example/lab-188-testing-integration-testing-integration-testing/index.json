  "description": "In this lab, integration testing is discussed, which involves testing multiple parts of a library together using its public interface. Integration tests can be placed in the tests directory next to the src directory in a Rust crate, and are executed using the cargo test command. Additionally, common code can be shared between integration tests by creating a module with public functions and importing it within the tests.",
