# Introduction

In this lab, we explore how to use combinators such as `map` and `and_then` for the `Result` type in Rust to handle errors more gracefully, as demonstrated in the provided examples.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
