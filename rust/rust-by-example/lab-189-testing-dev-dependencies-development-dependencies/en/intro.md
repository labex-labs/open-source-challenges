# Introduction

In this lab, the concept of development dependencies is explained. Development dependencies are added in the `[dev-dependencies]` section of the `Cargo.toml` file and are used for tests, examples, or benchmarks. An example of a development dependency is `pretty_assertions`, which extends standard macros like `assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!` to provide colorful diffs.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
