  "description": "In this lab, the concept of development dependencies is explained. Development dependencies are added in the [dev-dependencies] section of the Cargo.toml file and are used for tests, examples, or benchmarks. An example of a development dependency is pretty_assertions, which extends standard macros like assert_eq! and assert_ne! to provide colorful diffs.",
