# Introduction

In this lab, the concept of freezing is explained as the state when data is bound by the same name immutably, making it unable to be modified until the immutable binding goes out of scope.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
