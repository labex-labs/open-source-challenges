# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the concept of traits in Rust, which are a collection of methods defined for an unknown type called `Self`. Traits can be implemented for any data type, allowing the use of methods defined within the trait.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
