  "description": "In this lab, it is explained that in order to use the std::fmt formatting traits, types must have an implementation to be printable, which can be automatically provided for types in the std library. For other types, the fmt::Debug trait can be derived to enable printing. The fmt::Debug trait makes it straightforward to implement printable types, while fmt::Display needs to be manually implemented. The fmt::Debug trait allows all types to derive the implementation for printing, and the same applies to {:?} for std library types. The lab also mentions the use of {:?} for printing and provides an example of how to use it to print different types. Additionally, the concept of 'pretty printing' with {:#?} is introduced, which provides a more elegant representation of data structures. Finally, it is mentioned that fmt::Display can be manually implemented to have control over the display of types.",
