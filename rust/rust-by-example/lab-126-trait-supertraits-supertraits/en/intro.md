# Introduction

In this lab, we explore how to define traits in Rust as supersets of other traits, allowing for the implementation of multiple traits through subtraits.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
