# Introduction

In this lab, you can learn about how arrays and slices can be destructured in Rust, demonstrated through a code example that showcases different patterns for matching values in the array and binding them to variables.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
