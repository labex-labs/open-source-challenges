# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the panic strategy options `abort` and `unwind`, which can be used to handle errors in Rust code.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
