# Introduction

In this lab, the usage of `while let` in Rust is demonstrated as a more concise and efficient alternative to using `match` sequences when incrementing variables or iterating over Option types.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
