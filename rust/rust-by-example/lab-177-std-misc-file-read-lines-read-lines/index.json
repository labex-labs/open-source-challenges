  "description": "In this lab, we are given a naive implementation and a more efficient implementation for reading lines from a file in Rust. The naive approach uses read_to_string to read the file into a single string and then splits it into lines, while the more efficient approach uses a BufReader to read the file line by line without loading the entire contents into memory.",
