# Introduction

In this lab, we explore closures in Rust and their capturing behavior, which allows them to capture variables by reference, mutable reference, or value, depending on the requirements of the closure.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
