# Introduction

In this lab, we have code that demonstrates the usage of enums in Rust, including how to destructure an enum using a match statement and access the associated values based on the enum variant.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
