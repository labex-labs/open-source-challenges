# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concepts of destructuring and dereferencing in Rust, highlighting the differences in their usage compared to languages like C/C++. Destructuring involves using `&`, `ref`, and `ref mut` to assign and match references, while dereferencing is done using `*` to access the value pointed to by a reference.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
