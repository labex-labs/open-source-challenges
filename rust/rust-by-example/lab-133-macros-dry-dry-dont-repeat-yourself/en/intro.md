# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the concept of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) in coding by using macros to factor out common parts of functions and test suites.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
