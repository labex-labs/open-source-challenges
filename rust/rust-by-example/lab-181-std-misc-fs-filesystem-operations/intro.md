# Introduction

In this lab, the `std::fs` module in Rust is introduced, which provides functions for filesystem operations. The lab provides examples of various filesystem operations including creating directories, creating files, reading file contents, creating symbolic links, listing directory contents, removing files, and removing directories. The code snippets demonstrate how to perform these operations using the `std::fs` module functions, and the expected output for each operation is provided. Additionally, an alternative implementation of the `cat` function using the `?` notation for error handling is mentioned.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
