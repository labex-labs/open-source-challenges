# Introduction

In this lab, it is explained that the `crate_type` and `crate_name` attributes in Rust have no effect when using Cargo, the Rust package manager, which is widely used for Rust projects.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
