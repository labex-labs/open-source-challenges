# Introduction

In this lab, we learn how to create aliases for a specific `Result` type in Rust, allowing us to reuse it multiple times and conveniently define all associated `Results` within a module.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
