# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the functionalities of the HashSet data structure in Rust, which guarantees unique elements and can perform operations such as union, difference, intersection, and symmetric difference on sets.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
