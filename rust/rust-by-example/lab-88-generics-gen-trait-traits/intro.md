# Introduction

In this lab, a generic `DoubleDrop` trait is defined, which includes a `double_drop` method that allows a type to deallocate itself and an input parameter.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
