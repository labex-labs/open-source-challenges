  "description": "In this lab, we explore the concept of associated types in Rust, which allows for improved readability of code by defining inner types locally within a trait as output types. This is achieved by using the type keyword within the trait definition. With associated types, functions that use the trait no longer need to explicitly express the types A and B, making the code more concise and flexible. We rewrite an example from a previous section using associated types to illustrate their usage in practice.",
