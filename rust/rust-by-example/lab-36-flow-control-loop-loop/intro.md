# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the usage of the `loop` keyword in Rust, which allows us to create an infinite loop. We can exit the loop at any time using the `break` statement and skip the remaining iterations using the `continue` statement. The provided example code demonstrates how to increment a counter and print its value until it reaches a certain condition, utilizing `continue` to skip one iteration and `break` to exit the loop entirely.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
