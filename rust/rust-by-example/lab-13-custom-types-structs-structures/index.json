  "description": "In this lab, we will be exploring structures in the Rust programming language. There are three types of structures (\"structs\") that can be created using the `struct` keyword: tuple structs, classic C structs, and unit structs. Tuple structs are essentially named tuples, C structs are the traditional structs found in C programming, and unit structs are field-less and useful for generics. We can define structs with multiple fields, such as `Person` which has `name` and `age` fields. Structs can also be reused as fields of another struct, as shown in the example of a `Rectangle` which consists of two `Point` structs representing the top left and bottom right corners. We can initialize structs using field init shorthand and access their fields using dot notation. It is also possible to destructure structs using the `let` binding. Additionally, the lab provides two activities - creating a function `rect_area` to calculate the area of a `Rectangle` using nested destructuring, and creating a function `square` that takes a `Point` and a `f32` as arguments and returns a `Rectangle` with its top left corner on the point and a width and height corresponding to the `f32`.",
