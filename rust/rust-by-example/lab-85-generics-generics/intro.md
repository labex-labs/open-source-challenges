# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the topic of generics, which involves generalizing types and functionalities to handle a broader range of cases, reducing code duplication. The syntax for generics in Rust involves specifying type parameters using angle brackets, such as `<T>`. By using generics, we can create generic functions that can accept arguments of any type. Furthermore, we can define generic types that can work with different concrete types.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
