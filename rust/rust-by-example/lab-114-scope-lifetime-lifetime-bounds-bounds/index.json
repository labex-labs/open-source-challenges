  "title": "Rust Lifetime and Trait Bounds",
  "description": "In this lab, we learn about bounds in Rust, which are used to restrict the lifetimes or traits of generic types. The : character is used to indicate that all references in a type must outlive a certain lifetime, while + is used to indicate that a type must implement a trait and all references in it must outlive a certain lifetime. An example code snippet demonstrates the syntax and usage of bounds in Rust.",
