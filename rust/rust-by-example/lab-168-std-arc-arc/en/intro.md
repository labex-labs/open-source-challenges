# Introduction

In this lab, we explore the usage of `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) in Rust, which is employed when shared ownership between threads is required.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
