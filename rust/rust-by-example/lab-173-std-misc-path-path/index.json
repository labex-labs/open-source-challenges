  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the Path struct in Rust, which represents file paths in the underlying filesystem. It comes in two flavors: posix::Path for UNIX-like systems and windows::Path for Windows. The Path can be created from an OsStr and provides various methods to retrieve information from the file or directory that the path points to. It is important to note that a Path is immutable, and its owned version is called PathBuf, which can be mutated in-place. The relation between Path and PathBuf is similar to that between str and String.",
