# Introduction

In this lab, we see an example where an `Option` needs to interact with a `Result`, or a `Result<T, Error1>` needs to interact with a `Result<T, Error2>`.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
