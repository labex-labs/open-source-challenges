# Introduction

In this lab, we learn about using the `Clone` trait in Rust to make copies of resources, such as structs, by using the `.clone()` method. The `Clone` trait allows us to create independent copies of resources, and we can use the `.clone()` method to create a new instance with the same values.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
