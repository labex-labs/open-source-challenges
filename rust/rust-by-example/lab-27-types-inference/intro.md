# Introduction

In this lab, the type inference engine is highlighted for its ability to deduce the type of a variable based on its usage and value assignment, demonstrated in an advanced example using Rust programming language.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
