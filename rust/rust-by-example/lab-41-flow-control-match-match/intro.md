# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how Rust provides pattern matching using the `match` keyword, which functions similarly to a `switch` statement in C.

> **Note:** If the lab does not specify a file name, you can use any file name you want. For example, you can use `main.rs`, compile and run it with `rustc main.rs && ./main`.
