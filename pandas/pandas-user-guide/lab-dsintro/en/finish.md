# Summary

In this lab, we have learned about the two fundamental data structures in pandas: Series and DataFrame. We've seen how to create and manipulate these structures, and how to use NumPy functions directly on them. We also explored the concept of data alignment, which is a powerful feature of pandas that allows for intuitive data manipulation and analysis.
