# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Nullable Boolean data type, provided by the Pandas library in Python. We will learn how to use this feature in indexing and logical operations, and how it differs from traditional boolean operations due to the presence of 'NA' values.

> You can open the `boolean.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
