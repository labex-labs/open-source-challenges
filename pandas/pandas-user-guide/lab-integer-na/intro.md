# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the nullable integer data type in pandas, which is an efficient way to handle integer data that may contain missing values. We will learn how to construct arrays with this data type, perform operations, and handle missing values effectively.

> You can write code in `integer-na.ipynb`.
