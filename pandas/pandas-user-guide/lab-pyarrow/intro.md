# Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of utilizing PyArrow in pandas to extend functionality and improve the performance of various APIs. PyArrow enhances pandas with more extensive data types, missing data support for all data types, IO reader integration, and interoperability with other data frame libraries.

> You can open the `pyarrow.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
