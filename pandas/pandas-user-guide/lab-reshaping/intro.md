# Introduction

In data analysis, it is common to encounter datasets that are not arranged in the way we want. Reshaping data refers to the process of changing how data is organized into rows and columns. In this lab, we will explore some of the key methods in Pandas for reshaping data including Pivot, Stack, Unstack, Melt, Cross tabulations, Tiling, Factorizing, and Exploding.
