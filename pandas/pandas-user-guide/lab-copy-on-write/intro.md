# Introduction

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on understanding and implementing the concept of Copy-On-Write (CoW) in Python Pandas. CoW is an optimization strategy that enhances performance and memory usage by delaying copies as long as possible. It also helps in avoiding accidental modifications of more than one object.

> You can open the `copy-on-write.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
