# Introduction

Welcome to the Pandas Basics Lab! In this lab, we will explore some fundamental aspects of the Pandas library: DataFrame memory usage, handling if/truth statements, using User Defined Function (UDF) methods, dealing with NA values, differences with NumPy, and thread-safety considerations.

You can open the `gotchas.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
