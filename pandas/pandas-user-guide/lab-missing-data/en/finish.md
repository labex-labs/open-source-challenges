# Summary

In this lab, we have learned how to handle missing data using pandas. We have covered how to detect, insert, calculate with, and drop missing data. We have also learned how to interpolate and replace missing values. Lastly, we have discussed the experimental `NA` scalar in pandas to denote missing values. This knowledge will be very useful when dealing with real-world data analysis tasks where missing data is often a common issue.
