# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to handle missing data in pandas, a common issue in data analysis. We'll cover how to identify missing data, fill in missing values, and drop data that's not needed. We will also discuss the experimental `NA` scalar in pandas that can be used to denote missing values.

> You can write code in `missing-data.ipynb`.
