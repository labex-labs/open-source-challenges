# Introduction

This lab focuses on how to scale data analysis to larger datasets using pandas. It covers methods like loading less data, using efficient data types, chunking, and leveraging other libraries like Dask. It is important to note that pandas is more suited for in-memory analytics and might not be the best tool for very large datasets.

> You can write code in `scale.ipynb`.
