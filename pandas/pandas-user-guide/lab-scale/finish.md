# Summary

In this lab, we demonstrated different techniques for scaling data analysis to larger datasets using pandas. We generated a large dataset, learned how to load less data, use efficient datatypes, and chunking. We also explored how to leverage other libraries like Dask for handling larger-than-memory datasets. The techniques and concepts learned in this lab will be useful when dealing with large datasets in data analysis projects.
