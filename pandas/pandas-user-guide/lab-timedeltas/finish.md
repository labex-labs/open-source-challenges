# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to work with time deltas in Python using the pandas library. We covered how to construct a timedelta, convert to timedelta, perform operations, access attributes, convert to ISO 8601 Duration, create a timedelta index, use the timedelta index, perform operations with timedelta index, and resample a timedelta index. With these skills, you can efficiently handle and manipulate time-based data in your future data analysis tasks.
