# Summary

This lab guide explained how to get, set, and reset options in pandas. We also discussed how to describe options and use the `option_context` function. Finally, we explored how to set startup options in the Python/IPython environment. These techniques allow us to customize and configure the behavior of pandas to suit our needs.
