# Introduction

This lab focuses on understanding how to configure and customize global behavior related to Pandas DataFrame display, data behavior, and more. We will explore how to get/set options, reset options to their default values, and describe options. We will also learn how to execute a code block with a set of options that revert to prior settings after execution.

You can open the `options.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
