# Introduction

This lab focuses on understanding how to configure and customize global behavior related to Pandas DataFrame display, data behavior, and more. We will explore how to get/set options, reset options to their default values, and describe options. We will also learn how to execute a code block with a set of options that revert to prior settings after execution.

> You can write code in `options.ipynb`.
