# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to handle text data in pandas. We learned how to store text data, use string methods for data preprocessing and transformation, extract substrings using regular expressions, test whether elements contain or match a pattern, and create dummy variables. These techniques are fundamental for processing text data for machine learning algorithms.
