# Introduction

This lab introduces how to handle text data in pandas. We will learn how to store text data, use string methods for data preprocessing and transformation, and extract substrings using regular expressions. We will also learn how to create dummy variables for machine learning algorithms.

> You can open the `text.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
