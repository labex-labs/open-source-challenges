# Introduction

This lab will guide you on how to use sparse data structures in the pandas library. This is useful in scenarios where we have large volumes of data, most of which are similar (like zero or NaN), hence can be represented more efficiently in memory. We will learn about the `SparseArray`, `SparseDtype`, sparse accessor, sparse calculation, and interaction with scipy sparse matrices.

> You can write code in `sparse.ipynb`.
