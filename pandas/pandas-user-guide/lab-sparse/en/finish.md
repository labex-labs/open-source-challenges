# Summary

In this lab, we have learnt how to use sparse data structures in pandas for memory-efficient storage and computation. We have used `SparseArray`, `SparseDtype`, and performed sparse calculations. We also learnt how to convert between dense and sparse, and how to interact with scipy sparse matrices.
