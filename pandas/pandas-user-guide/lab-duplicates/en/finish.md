# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to handle duplicate labels in pandas. We understood the consequences of having duplicate labels, learned how to detect them, and how to disallow them if needed. This is an essential skill when dealing with large datasets where duplicate labels could potentially lead to erroneous data analysis and results.
