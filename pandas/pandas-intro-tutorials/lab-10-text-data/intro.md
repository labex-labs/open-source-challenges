In this lab, we will explore how to manipulate textual data using Python's Pandas library. You will learn how to convert string characters to lowercase, extract parts of strings, replace string values and more using various built-in Pandas methods.

You can open the `10-text-data.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
