# Summary

In this lab, we have seen how to manipulate textual data using Python's Pandas library. We have learnt how to convert string characters to lowercase, extract parts of strings, find specific rows based on string contents, find the longest string, and replace string values. This knowledge is very useful in data preprocessing, a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning.
