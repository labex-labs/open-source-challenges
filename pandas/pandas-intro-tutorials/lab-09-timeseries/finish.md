# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to handle time series data in Python using the pandas library. We loaded air quality data, converted date strings to datetime objects, calculated the average NO2 concentration for each day of the week, plotted the average NO2 values for each hour of the day, and resampled the time series data to a different frequency.
