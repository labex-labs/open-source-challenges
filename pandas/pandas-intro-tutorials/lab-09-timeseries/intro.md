# Introduction

This lab will guide you through handling time series data using the Python package, Pandas. We will be working with air quality data for this tutorial. You will learn how to convert strings into datetime objects, perform operations on these datetime objects, resample time series to another frequency, and more.

> You can write code in `09-timeseries.ipynb`.
