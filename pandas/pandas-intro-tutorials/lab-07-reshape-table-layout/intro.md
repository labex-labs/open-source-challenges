# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to reshape data in pandas using various functions like `sort_values`, `pivot`, `pivot_table`, and `melt`. We will work with the Titanic and Air Quality datasets to demonstrate the reshaping techniques.

> You can write code in `07-reshape-table-layout.ipynb`.
