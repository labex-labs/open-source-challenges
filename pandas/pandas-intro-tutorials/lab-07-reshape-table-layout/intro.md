# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to reshape data in pandas using various functions like `sort_values`, `pivot`, `pivot_table`, and `melt`. We will work with the Titanic and Air Quality datasets to demonstrate the reshaping techniques.

> You can open the `07-reshape-table-layout.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
