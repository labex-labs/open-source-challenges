# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to reshape data in pandas using various functions like `sort_values`, `pivot`, `pivot_table`, and `melt`. We applied these techniques on the Titanic and Air Quality datasets to sort, pivot, and melt the data. These reshaping techniques are essential when working with data in pandas and can help us to efficiently analyze and visualize the data.
