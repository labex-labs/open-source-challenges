# Introduction

In this lab, we are going to learn how to select specific data from a DataFrame using Pandas, a popular data analysis and manipulation library in Python. We will use the Titanic dataset for this tutorial.

You can open the `03-subset-data.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
