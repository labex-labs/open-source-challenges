# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create plots using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. We will use real air quality data for practical illustrations. By the end of this lab, you should be able to use Pandas to create line plots, scatter plots, box plots, and customize your plots.

> You can write code in `04-plotting.ipynb`.
