# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use Python's Pandas library to calculate summary statistics for data. We will use the Titanic dataset, which contains data on passengers from the Titanic shipwreck. We will learn how to calculate summary statistics, aggregate statistics, and count the number of records by category.

> You can open the `06-calculate-statistics.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
