# Introduction

In this lab, we will work with air quality data to explore how to combine multiple tables using Python's Pandas library. We will be using the `concat` and `merge` functions to perform these operations. This lab will help you understand how to concatenate and merge data frames effectively.

> You can write code in `08-combine-dataframes.ipynb`.
