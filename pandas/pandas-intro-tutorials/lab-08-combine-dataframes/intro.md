# Introduction

In this lab, we will work with air quality data to explore how to combine multiple tables using Python's Pandas library. We will be using the `concat` and `merge` functions to perform these operations. This lab will help you understand how to concatenate and merge data frames effectively.

You can open the `08-combine-dataframes.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
