# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to work with columns in Pandas. We will explore how to create new columns derived from existing ones, apply mathematical and logical operations on columns, rename column labels, and perform column-wise operations using the `apply` method.

> You can open the `05-add-columns.ipynb` in WebIDE to start the exercises. Learn how to use [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
