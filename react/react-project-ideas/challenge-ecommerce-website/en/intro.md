# Introduction

In this tutorial we will develop a shopping website aka Reactjs Ecommerce (with open source code) project using Reactjs Context API. This tutorial will teach you to develop an ecommerce website with basic functionality i.e. show products, add to cart, review and checkout and place & view orders.
For routing we will use 'react-router-dom' npm package.
