# Introduction

In this lab, we will be creating a React component that renders a textarea with a word limit. The component will utilize React hooks such as `useState()`, `useCallback()`, and `useEffect()` to manage the state of the textarea and limit the number of words that can be entered. This lab provides a practical example of how to utilize hooks to create reusable React components.
