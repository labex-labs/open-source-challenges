# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the use of the `useIsomorphicEffect` hook in React. This hook allows for the resolution of `useEffect()` on the server and `useLayoutEffect()` on the client, ensuring that the same effect is executed regardless of the environment. Through this lab, we will learn how to use the `useIsomorphicEffect` hook to create consistent and reliable effects in our React applications.
