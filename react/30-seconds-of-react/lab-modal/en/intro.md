# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a Modal component in React that can be controlled through events. The Modal component will have a close button, and the keyboard event listener will be used to close the modal when the Esc key is pressed. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to create a reusable Modal component that can be easily integrated into any React project.
