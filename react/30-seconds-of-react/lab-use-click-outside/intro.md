# Introduction

In this lab, we will be learning how to use the `useClickOutside` hook in React to handle click events that occur outside of a specific component. This custom hook allows us to easily detect when a user clicks outside of a specific component and perform an action based on that event. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use this hook to create more interactive and user-friendly components in your React applications.
