# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a Tag Input Field in React using the useState() hook. The Tag Input Field is a popular UI component used in many web applications to collect user input as tags. We will explore how to add and remove tags dynamically using the addTagData() and removeTagData() methods. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement the Tag Input Field in your React projects.
