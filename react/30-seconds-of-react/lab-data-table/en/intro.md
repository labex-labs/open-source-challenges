# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use React to dynamically render a table with rows created from an array of primitives. Specifically, we will utilize the `Array.prototype.map()` method to map each item in the data array to a `<tr>` element with an appropriate key and display it in a table with two columns: ID and Value. By the end of this lab, you will gain a better understanding of how to use React to create dynamic and responsive tables.
