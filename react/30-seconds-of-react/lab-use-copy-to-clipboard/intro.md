# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useCopyToClipboard` hook in React to copy a given text to the clipboard. This hook is useful for implementing a "copy to clipboard" functionality in web applications. We will also see how to use the `useState`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect` hooks in this implementation.
