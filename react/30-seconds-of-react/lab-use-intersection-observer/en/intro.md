# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useIntersectionObserver` hook in React to observe the visibility changes of a given element. This hook can be used to track when an element becomes visible on the screen and trigger certain actions accordingly. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement this hook in your React projects to create more interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
