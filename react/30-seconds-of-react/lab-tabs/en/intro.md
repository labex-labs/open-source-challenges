# Introduction

In this lab, we will be creating a Tabs component in React that allows users to switch between different content views by clicking on a menu. We will be using the useState() hook to manage the active tab index and the map() method to render the tab menu and content view. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to build reusable components in React using state and props.
