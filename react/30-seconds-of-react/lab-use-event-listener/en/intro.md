# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the use of the `useEventListener` hook in React. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to add event listeners to elements in a React application, and how to clean them up properly to avoid memory leaks. Through practical examples, you will learn how to use this hook to create more interactive and responsive user interfaces.
