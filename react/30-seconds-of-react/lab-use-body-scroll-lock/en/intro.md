# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to implement the `useBodyScrollLock()` hook in a React application. This hook allows us to disable scrolling on the body element of a webpage while a modal or other overlay is open. By using this hook, we can prevent users from accidentally scrolling away from the content they are trying to interact with.
