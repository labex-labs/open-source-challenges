# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to implement the `setInterval()` function in a declarative way using the `useInterval` custom hook in React. This hook helps us to set up intervals for performing tasks repeatedly at a specified time interval. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use the `useInterval` hook to create timers, animations, and other time-based features in your React applications.
