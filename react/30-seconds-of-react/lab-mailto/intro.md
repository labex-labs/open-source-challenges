# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an `Email Link` component in React that generates a link formatted to send an email. This component will use the `mailto:` link format and will accept props for the email recipient, email subject, and email body. We will also learn how to safely encode the email subject and body using `encodeURIComponent`.
