# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `useComponentWillUnmount` hook in React, which allows us to execute a callback function right before a component is unmounted and destroyed. By using this hook, we can perform any necessary cleanup tasks, such as removing event listeners or cancelling any pending requests. This lab will provide hands-on experience in using this hook and understanding its behavior, which is similar to the `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method in class components.
