# Introduction

In this lab, we will be learning how to use the `useForm` hook in React to create a stateful value from the fields in a form. This will allow us to easily manage the state of our form inputs and update them as needed. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create and manage forms in React using the `useForm` hook.
