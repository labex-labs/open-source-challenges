# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a collapsible content component in React using the `useState` hook. This component will allow users to toggle the visibility of content by clicking on a button, making it a useful tool for organizing and presenting information on a webpage. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create reusable components in React that improve the accessibility and user experience of your web applications.
