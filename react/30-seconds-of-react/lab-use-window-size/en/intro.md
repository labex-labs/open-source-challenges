# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useWindowSize` hook in React to track the dimensions of the browser window. This hook enables us to create responsive designs and adjust the layout of our components based on the size of the user's screen. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use hooks in React and how to create more user-friendly applications.
