# Introduction

In this lab, we will work with the `useSearchParam` hook which tracks the browser's location search param. This hook allows us to get the current value of a specified parameter in the URL and update it dynamically when the URL changes. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use this hook in your React applications to handle URL parameters.
