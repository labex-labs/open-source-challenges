# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a custom React hook called `useKeyPress` that listens for changes in the pressed state of a given key. This hook will be useful in scenarios where we need to detect whether a specific key is being pressed by the user. We will use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to handle state and event listeners, respectively.
