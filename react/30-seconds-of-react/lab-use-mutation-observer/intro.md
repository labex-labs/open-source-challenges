# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useMutationObserver` hook in React to watch for changes made to the DOM tree using a `MutationObserver`. The hook allows us to specify a callback function to be executed when a change is observed, and we can also provide options to customize the observer's behavior. Through this lab, we will be able to understand how to implement the `useMutationObserver` hook in our React applications.
