# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useDelayedState` hook in React to delay the creation of a stateful value until a certain condition is met. This hook is useful when we need to wait for data or props to load before creating a stateful value, and can help improve the performance of our application. Through practical examples, we will see how this hook can be implemented and how it can be used to update stateful values in our React components.
