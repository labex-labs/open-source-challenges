# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `useUnload` hook in React, which allows us to handle the `beforeunload` window event. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to use this hook to create a callback function that will be triggered when the user tries to close the window. We will also learn how to perform cleanup after the component is unmounted. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manage window events in React.
