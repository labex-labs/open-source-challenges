# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create an uncontrolled range input element in React that allows users to select values from a range of numbers by sliding a button along a horizontal line. We will use a callback function to pass the selected value to the parent component. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use the `onChange` event and `defaultValue` property in React.
