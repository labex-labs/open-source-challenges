# Introduction

In this lab, we will be learning how to use the `useComponentDidMount` hook in React. This hook allows us to execute a callback immediately after a component is mounted, similar to the `componentDidMount()` method of class components. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use this hook and how it can be useful in your React projects.
