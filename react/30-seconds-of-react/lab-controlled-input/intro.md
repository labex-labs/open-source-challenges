# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a controlled input field in React. The controlled input field is a common pattern used to manage form input values in React applications. By using a callback function to inform the parent component of any value updates, we can ensure that the input field's value is always in sync with the state of the parent component. This lab will guide us through the creation and usage of a controlled input field component in React.
