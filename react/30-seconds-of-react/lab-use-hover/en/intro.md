# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the implementation of a custom hook called `useHover` in React. This hook will handle the event of hovering over a wrapped component and update the state accordingly. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create and use custom hooks in React to enhance the functionality of your components.
