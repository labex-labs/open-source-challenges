# Introduction

In this lab, we will be building a countdown timer component using React. The timer will accept props for the starting time and will render a visual representation of the time left. It will also include buttons to pause, resume, and restart the timer, and will display a message when the time runs out. By completing this lab, you will gain experience using state and effects in React to build dynamic and interactive components.
