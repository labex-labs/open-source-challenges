# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a stateful `Set` object in a React component using the `useSet` hook. This hook provides a simple and efficient way to manipulate a set of values in a component and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the application. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to implement and use this powerful hook in your React projects.
