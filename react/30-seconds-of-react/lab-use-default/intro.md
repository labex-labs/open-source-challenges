# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to create a custom hook called `useDefault` in React. The purpose of this hook is to create a stateful value with a default fallback if it's `null` or `undefined`, and a function to update it. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use custom hooks to simplify your React code and make it more efficient.
