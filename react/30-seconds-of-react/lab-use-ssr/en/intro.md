# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the use of the `useSSR` hook in React. This hook allows us to check whether our code is running on the browser or the server, and provides additional information about the environment such as the availability of workers, event listeners, and viewport. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to write React code that is optimized for different environments.
