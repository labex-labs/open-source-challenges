# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create an uncontrolled input field in React. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how to use a callback function to inform the parent component about any changes made to the value of the input field. We will use the `defaultValue` and `onChange` props to set the initial value of the input field and to update the parent component with any value changes.
