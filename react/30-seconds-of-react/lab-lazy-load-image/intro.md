# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to implement lazy loading images in a React application. Lazy loading improves page performance by delaying the loading of images until they are needed, reducing the initial load time and improving the user experience. We will use the Intersection Observer API and React hooks to create a reusable component that supports lazy loading images.
