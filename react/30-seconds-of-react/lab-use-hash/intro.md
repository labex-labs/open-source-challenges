# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useHash` hook in React to track and update the browser's location hash value. This hook is useful for creating single-page applications where different components or sections of the page are displayed based on the hash value. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement the `useHash` hook in your React projects and enhance the user experience of your web applications.
