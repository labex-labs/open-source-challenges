# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an uncontrolled `<textarea>` element in React. The purpose of this lab is to showcase how to use the `defaultValue` and `onChange` props to pass the value of the text area to a callback function in the parent component. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create uncontrolled input fields in React.
