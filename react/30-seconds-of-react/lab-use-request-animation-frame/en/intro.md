# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `useRequestAnimationFrame` hook in React to animate a function, ensuring that it runs before every repaint. This hook is useful for creating smooth and efficient animations in web applications. We will walk through the process of creating the hook and implementing it in a simple counter component that updates in real-time.
