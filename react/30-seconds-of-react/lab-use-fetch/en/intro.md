# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the useFetch hook in React. This hook allows us to implement the fetch() method in a declarative manner, making it easier to fetch data from APIs and update the component state. We will create a custom hook that takes a URL and options, and asynchronously calls fetch() to update the response, error, and abort state variables.
