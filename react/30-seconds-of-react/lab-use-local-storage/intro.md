# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the useLocalStorage hook in React. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to create a stateful value that is persisted to localStorage and a function to update it. You will learn how to use the useState hook, try-catch block, and Storage.getItem() and Storage.setItem() methods to store and retrieve data from localStorage. By the end of this lab, you will have gained a better understanding of how to build React applications that utilize localStorage to store and persist data.
