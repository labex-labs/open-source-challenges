# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useAsync` hook in React to handle asynchronous calls. This custom hook allows us to define a handler function and then run it asynchronously while updating the state of our component using the `useReducer` hook. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create reusable code for handling asynchronous data in your React applications.
