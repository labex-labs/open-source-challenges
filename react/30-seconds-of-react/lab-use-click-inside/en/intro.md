# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a custom React hook called `useClickInside`. This hook will handle the event of clicking inside a wrapped component and trigger a callback function. We will use `useEffect()` and `useRef()` hooks to append and clean up the `click` event. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create custom hooks and handle events in React.
