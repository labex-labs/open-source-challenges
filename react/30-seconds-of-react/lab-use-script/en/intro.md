# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useScript` hook in React to dynamically load an external script. This hook can be used to efficiently handle the loading and unloading of scripts, and it can be especially useful when working with third-party libraries or APIs. By the end of this lab, you will be able to use the `useScript` hook to load external scripts in your React applications.
