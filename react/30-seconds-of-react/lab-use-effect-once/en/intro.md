# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useEffectOnce` hook in React to run a callback function at most once when a certain condition becomes true. This can be useful for situations where we want to execute a specific action only once, such as when a component mounts or when a button is clicked. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to implement this hook in your React applications.
