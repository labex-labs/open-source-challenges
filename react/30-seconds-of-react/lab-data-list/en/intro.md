# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a dynamic list component in React using the `DataList` component. With this component, we can render an array of primitive values as an ordered or unordered list. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use `Array.prototype.map()` and conditionally render elements based on props in React.
