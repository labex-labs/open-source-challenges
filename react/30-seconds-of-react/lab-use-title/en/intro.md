# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to use the `useTitle` hook in React to dynamically set the title of a web page. This hook is useful when building web applications that require changing the page title dynamically based on the content being displayed. Through this lab, we will explore how to implement the `useTitle` hook and use it in a practical example.
