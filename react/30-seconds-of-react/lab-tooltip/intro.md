# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a tooltip component in React using state and event handlers. Tooltips are small pop-up boxes that appear when the user hovers over an element, providing additional information. By the end of the lab, you will be able to create customizable tooltips that can be easily integrated into your React applications.
