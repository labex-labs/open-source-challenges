# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an uncontrolled `<select>` element in React using callback functions to pass its value to the parent component. We will use the `selectedValue` prop to set the initial value of the `<select>` element, and the `onChange` event to send the new value to the parent. This lab will also cover how to use `Array.prototype.map()` to create `<option>` elements for each passed value.
