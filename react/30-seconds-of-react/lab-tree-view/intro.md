# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an expandable object tree view in React. This component is useful for displaying complex data structures in a structured and collapsible format. We will use the useState hook and recursion to render a tree view of a JSON object or array with collapsible content. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create and customize a tree view component to display your data in a clear and organized way.
