# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the useMap hook in React, which creates a stateful Map object and a set of functions to manipulate it. By using this hook, we can easily manage and update key-value pairs in our React components without having to write complex and error-prone logic. This lab will guide you through the implementation of the useMap hook and demonstrate its usage in a sample application.
