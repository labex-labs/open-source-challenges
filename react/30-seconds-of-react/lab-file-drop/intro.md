# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a file drag and drop component in React using the useState and useEffect hooks. This component allows users to easily drag and drop files onto a designated area and triggers a callback function with the dropped file as an argument. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to handle drag and drop functionality in React.
