# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the use of the `usePortal` hook in React. The purpose of this hook is to create a portal that allows rendering of children outside the parent component. We will learn how to use the `useState()`, `useCallback()`, and `useEffect()` hooks to create and manage a portal, as well as how to use `ReactDOM.createPortal()` and `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()` to render and remove the portal.
