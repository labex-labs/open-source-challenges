# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the use of the `useUpdate` hook in React. This hook allows us to force a component to re-render when called, which can be useful for updating the UI with new data or changes. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to implement this hook in your React projects to improve the performance and functionality of your applications.
