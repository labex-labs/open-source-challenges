# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to implement a toggle component using React. The toggle component is a common UI element used to switch between two states. We will use the `useState()` hook to manage the component's state and apply different CSS classes based on its state. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create reusable UI components in React.
