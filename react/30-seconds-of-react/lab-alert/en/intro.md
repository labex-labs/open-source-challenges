# Introduction

In this lab, we will be creating a Closable Alert component using React. The component will allow users to display a message of a specific type and close the alert when they are done with it. By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to use the `useState()` and `useEffect()` hooks to create a dynamic component that can be easily customized to fit your needs.
