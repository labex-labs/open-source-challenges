# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the `useComponentDidUpdate` hook in React. This hook allows us to execute a callback immediately after a component is updated, similar to the `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle method of class components. We will explore how to use this hook to track changes to specific state variables and run custom logic accordingly.
