# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `useOnWindowScroll` hook in React to execute a callback whenever the window is scrolled. This hook allows us to add a scroll listener to the `Window` global object and remove it when the component unmounts. By using this hook, we can easily add custom scroll behavior to our React components.
