# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a stateful checkbox with multiple selection using React. This lab will guide you through the process of rendering a checkbox list, updating its state, and passing the selected value/values to the parent component using a callback function. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a reusable checkbox component that can be used in any React project.
