# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to implement the `setTimeout()` function in a declarative manner using the `useTimeout` custom hook in React. This hook allows us to set up a timeout and clean it up easily, while also remembering the latest callback function. We will also see an example of using the `useTimeout` hook to create a one-second timer that updates the state of a component every second.
