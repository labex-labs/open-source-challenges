# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create an error dispatcher using the `useError` hook in React. The hook allows us to create a state variable that holds an error and throw it whenever it's truthy. We will also use the `useCallback` hook to update the state and return the cached function. By the end of this lab, you will be able to effectively handle errors in your React applications.
