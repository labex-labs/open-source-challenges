# Introduction

In this lab, we will be building a limited textarea component using React. The purpose of this lab is to provide a hands-on experience in utilizing React hooks, such as `useState()` and `useCallback()`, to create a component that limits the number of characters a user can input in a textarea. By the end of this lab, you will have a functional textarea component that displays the character count and limits the number of characters a user can input.
