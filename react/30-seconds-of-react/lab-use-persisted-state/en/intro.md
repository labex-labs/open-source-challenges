# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the `usePersistedState` hook in React, which allows us to persist a stateful value in `localStorage`. We will explore how to initialize and update the stored value, as well as how to handle changes to the key name. By the end of this lab, you will be able to use this hook in your React applications to ensure that certain data is stored and can be retrieved even after a page refresh.
