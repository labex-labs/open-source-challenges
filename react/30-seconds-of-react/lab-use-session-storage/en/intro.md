# Introduction

In this lab, we will be learning how to use the `useSessionStorage` hook in React to persist stateful values to `sessionStorage`. We will learn how to initialize the value lazily, retrieve and store values using `Storage.getItem()` and `Storage.setItem()`, and how to update the state variable using the defined function. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use `sessionStorage` to store and retrieve data within a React application.
