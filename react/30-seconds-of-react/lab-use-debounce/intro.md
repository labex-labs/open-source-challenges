# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a custom React hook called `useDebounce` that helps debounce user input. Debouncing is a technique that delays the invocation of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was called. This technique is commonly used in scenarios where the user input triggers frequent updates to the application state, as it can help reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.
