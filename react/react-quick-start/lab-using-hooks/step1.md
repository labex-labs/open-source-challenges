# Using Hooks

> The React project have already been provided in the VM. In general, you only need to add code to `App.js`.

Please use the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Functions starting with use are called Hooks. useState is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.

Hooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.

In the previous example, each `MyButton` had its own independent `count`, and when each button was clicked, only the `count` for the button clicked changed:

However, often you’ll need components to share data and always update together.

To make both MyButton components display the same count and update together, you need to move the state from the individual buttons “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them.

In this example, it is MyApp:

Now when you click either button, the `count` in `MyApp` will change, which will change both of the counts in `MyButton`. Here’s how you can express this in code.

First, move the state up from `MyButton` into `MyApp`:

```js
// App.js
export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton() {
  // ... we're moving code from here ...
}
```

Then, pass the state down from `MyApp` to each `MyButton`, together with the shared click handler. You can pass information to `MyButton` using the JSX curly braces, just like you previously did with built-in tags like `<img>`:

```js
export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update together</h1>
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The information you pass down like this is called props. Now the `MyApp` component contains the `count` state and the `handleClick` event handler, and passes both of them down as props to each of the buttons.

Finally, change `MyButton` to read the props you have passed from its parent component:

```js
function MyButton({ count, onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Clicked {count} times</button>;
}
```

When you click the button, the `onClick` handler fires. Each button’s `onClick` prop was set to the `handleClick` function inside `MyApp`, so the code inside of it runs. That code calls `setCount(count + 1)`, incrementing the `count` state variable. The new `count` value is passed as a prop to each button, so they all show the new value. This is called “lifting state up”. By moving state up, you’ve shared it between components.

```js
import { useState } from "react";

export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update together</h1>
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton({ count, onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Clicked {count} times</button>;
}
```
