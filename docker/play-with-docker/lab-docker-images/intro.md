# Introduction

In this lab we will see how to create an image from a container. Even if this is not used very often itâ€™s interesting to try it at least once.
Then we will focus on the image creation using a Dockerfile. We will then see how to get the details of an image through the inspection and explore the filesystem to have a better understanding of what happens behind the hood. We will end this lab with the image API.Let's have fun with Docker images!
