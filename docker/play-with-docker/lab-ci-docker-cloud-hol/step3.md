# Document conventions

When you encounter a phrase in between `<` and `>` you are meant to substitute in a different value.

For instance if you see `ssh <username>@<hostname>` you would actually type something like `ssh ubuntu@node0-gvs0mgc0216.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com`

You may be asked to SSH into various nodes. These nodes are referred to as **node0**, **node1** etc. These tags correspond to the very beginning of the hostnames you will find in your welcome email.
