# What is Docker Cloud?

Docker Cloud is Docker's cloud platform for individual developers and teams to build, ship, and run containerized applications. Docker Cloud enables teams to come together to collaborate on their projects and automate complex continuous delivery flows, which enables you to focus on improving your app, and leave the rest up to Docker Cloud.
