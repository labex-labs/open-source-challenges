# Trigger an Autobuild

Switch back the command line of your VM.

1.  If you have not already log into your Azure VM. For example (be sure to use the actual node name supplied in your email):

    `ssh ubuntu@node0-gvs0mgc0216.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com`

1.  Change to the directory containing the voting app.

        $ cd ~/voting-demo/voting

1.  Use vi or your favorite text editor to open `app.py`.

- To use `vi` on Linux: `$ vi app.py`

1.  Scroll down to find the lines containing `optionA` and `optionB`, and change **Dev** and **Ops** to **Futbol** and **Soccer**.

        optionA = "Futbol"
        optionB = "Soccer"

1.  Save your changes.

1.  Commit changes to the repository and push to GitHub using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

        $ git add *
        $ git commit -m "changing the voting options"
        [master 2ab640a] changing the voting options
        1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
