# Prerequisites

In order to complete this lab, you will need the following:

- A Docker ID
- A management host (for this lab you'll need a Linux named **node0**)
- A GitHub account
- Git installed
- [Docker installed](https://docker.com/getdocker) at the command-line

## Obtain a Docker ID

If you do not already have a Docker ID, you will need to create one now. Creating a Docker ID is free, and allows you to use [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com).

If you already have a Docker ID, skip to the next prerequisite.

To create a Docker ID:

1. Use your web browser to visit [`https://cloud.docker.com`](https://cloud.docker.com).

2. On the right hand side of the screen, enter your preferred Docker ID, supply your email address, and choose a password.

3. Click `Sign up`.

4. Check your email (**including your spam folder**) for a confirmation email.

5. Follow the steps outlined in the email.

6. You should be redirected back to `https://cloud.docker.com`.

You now have a Docker ID. Remember to keep the password safe and secure.

## GitHub account

In order to complete the CI portions of this lab, you will need an account on GitHub. If you do not already have one, you can create one for free at [GitHub](https://github.com).

Continue with the lab as soon as you have completed the prerequisites.
