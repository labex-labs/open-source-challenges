# Introduction

## Let's deploy the voting app stack on a swarm.

- Purpose :
  the purpose of this lab is to illustrate how to deploy a stack (multi services application) against a Swarm using a docker compose file.

- The application :
  the voting app is a very handy multi containers application often used for demo purposes during meetup and conferences.

  It basically allow users to vote between cat and dog (but could be "space" or "tab" too if you feel like it).

  This application is available on Github and updated very frequently when new features are developed.
