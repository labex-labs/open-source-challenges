# Prerequisites

You will need all of the following to complete this lab:

- A clone of the lab's GitHub repo.
- A DockerID.

## Clone the Lab's GitHub Repo

Use the following command to clone the lab's repo from GitHub (you can click the command or manually type it). This will make a copy of the lab's repo in a new sub-directory called `linux_tweet_app`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/linux_tweet_app
```

## Make sure you have a DockerID

If you do not have a DockerID (a free login used to access Docker Hub), please visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and register for one. You will need this for later steps.
