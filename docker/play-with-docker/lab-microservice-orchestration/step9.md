# Conclusions

We started this tutorial with a simple Python script that scrapes links from a given web page URL.
We demonstrated various difficulties in running the script.
We then illustrated how easy to run and portable the script becomes onces it is containerized.
In the later steps we gradually evolved the script into a multi-service application stack.
In the process we explored various concepts of microservice architecture and how Docker tools can be helpful in orchestrating a multi-service stack.
Finally, we demonstrated the ease of microservice component swapping and data persistence.

The next step would be to learn how to deploy such service stacks in a [Docker Swarm Cluster](/swarm-stack-intro).

As an aside, here are some introductory Docker slides.
