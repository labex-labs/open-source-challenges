  "description": "In this Hands-on Lab, we will show you how to take a traditional Java EE app, and compile it to run in a lightweight Java container. The app we've chosen is an old Java EE demo called Movie Plex 7 that was originally written to run in Wildfly 3. You can find our fork of the repo in our javaee-demo repository on GitHub. In fact, if you were to take that repository, and lift the movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT file, you could run that in a Java Application Server, such as WebLogic, Wildfly, or WebSphere.",
