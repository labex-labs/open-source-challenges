# Step 0: The Play with Docker Lab Environment

The terminal window on the right hand side of this web page is a Linux-based Docker host running in the Play with Docker (PWD) lab environment. This is where you will run all of the commands in this lab.

There are two ways of running commands in the terminal:

- Single-clicking any command will paste it into the terminal and execute it
- You can manually type each command into the terminal
