# Introduction

In this Hands-on Lab, we will show you how to take a traditional Java EE app, and compile it to run in a lightweight Java container. The app we've chosen is an old Java EE demo called Movie Plex 7 that was originally written to run in Wildfly 3. You can find our fork of the repo in our [javaee-demo](https://github.com/dockersamples/javaee-demo) repository on GitHub. In fact, if you were to take that repository, and lift the [movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/dockersamples/javaee-demo/blob/master/ear/movieplex7-1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear) file, you could run that in a Java Application Server, such as WebLogic, Wildfly, or WebSphere.

> If you aren't yet familiar with the basic concepts of Docker, you may wish to start with the Docker 101 lab before running this lab.
