  "description": "In this lab, we will leverage the power of Docker Swarm Mode, released with Docker 1.13, and the great features of vfarcic Docker Flow Proxy which provide an easy way to reconfigure proxy every time a new service is deployed, or when a service is scaled. It uses docker service labels to define the metadata and rules for its dynamically-configured routing rules to send traffic from the PRoxy to real applications (regardless of the host they are within a Docker Swarm Cluster).",
