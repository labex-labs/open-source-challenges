# Introduction

This is a short collection of tips and tricks showing how Docker
can be useful when working with Go code. For instance, I'll show
you how to compile Go code with different versions of the Go
toolchain, how to cross-compile to a different platform (and test
the result!), or how to produce really small container images.

The following article assumes that you have Docker installed on
your system. It doesn't have to be a recent version (we're not
going to use any fancy feature here).
