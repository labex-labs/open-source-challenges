# Wrapping it up

We saw how Docker can help us to compile Go code in a clean,
isolated environment; how to use different versions of the
Go toolchain; and how to cross-compile between different
operating systems and platforms.

We also saw how Go can help us to build small, lean container
images for Docker, and described a number of associated
subtleties linked (no pun intended) to static libraries
and network dependencies.

Beyond the fact that Go is really good fit for a project
that Docker, we hope that we showed you how Go and Docker
can benefit from each other and work really well together!
