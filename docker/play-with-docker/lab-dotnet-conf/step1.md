# Grab the code

The Play-with-Docker environment is already set up with Docker and Git, so you're good to go.

## Clone the source code from GitHub

Clone the application source into your local session:

> Just click the text in these boxes to send the command to your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/dotnetconf19.git
```

Now browse to the source code folder `dotnetconf19`:

```bash
cd dotnetconf19
```

In there you'll see a folder called `src` which contains the .NET code and a file called `Dockerfile` whch contains the instructions to build and package the app:

```bash
ls
```
