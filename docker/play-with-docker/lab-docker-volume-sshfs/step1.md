# Docker volume plugins

Docker Engine volume plugins enable Engine deployments to be integrated with external storage systems such as Amazon EBS, and enable data volumes to persist beyond the lifetime of a single Docker host. See [the plugin documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/legacy_plugins/) for more information.
