# Step 3: Inspect a network

The `docker network inspect` command is used to view network configuration details. These details include; name, ID, driver, IPAM driver, subnet info, connected containers, and more.

Use `docker network inspect <network>` to view configuration details of the container networks on your Docker host. The command below shows the details of the network called `bridge`.

```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

```
[
    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "3430ad6f20bf1486df2e5f64ddc93cc4ff95d81f59b6baea8a510ad500df2e57",
        "Created": "2017-04-03T16:49:58.6536278Z",
        "Scope": "local",
        "Driver": "bridge",
        "EnableIPv6": false,
        "IPAM": {
            "Driver": "default",
            "Options": null,
            "Config": [
                {
                    "Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
                    "Gateway": "172.17.0.1"
                }
            ]
        },
        "Internal": false,
        "Attachable": false,
        "Containers": {},
        "Options": {
            "com.docker.network.bridge.default_bridge": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade": "true",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
            "com.docker.network.bridge.name": "docker0",
            "com.docker.network.driver.mtu": "1500"
        },
        "Labels": {}
    }
]
```

> **NOTE:** The syntax of the `docker network inspect` command is `docker network inspect <network>`, where `<network>` can be either network name or network ID. In the example above we are showing the configuration details for the network called "bridge". Do not confuse this with the "bridge" driver.
