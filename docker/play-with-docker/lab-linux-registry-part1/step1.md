# Introduction

A registry is a service for storing and accessing Docker images. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com) are the best-known hosted registries, which you can use to store public and private images. You can also run your own registry using the open-source [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry), which is a Go application in a Alpine Linux container.
