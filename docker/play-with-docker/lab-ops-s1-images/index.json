  "description": "In the previous exercise you pulled down images from [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com) to run in your containers. Then you ran multiple instances and noted how each instance was isolated from the others. We hinted that this is used in many production IT environments every day but obviously we need a few more tools in our belt to get to the point where Docker can become a true time & money saver.",
