# Step 2.1 - Create a Manager node

In this step you'll initialize a new Swarm, join a single worker node, and verify the operations worked.

Run `docker swarm init` on **node1**.

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(hostname -i)
```

```
Swarm initialized: current node (6dlewb50pj2y66q4zi3egnwbi) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-1wxyoueqgpcrc4xk2t3ec7n1poy75g4kowmwz64p7ulqx611ih-68pazn0mj8p4p4lnuf4ctp8xy \
    10.0.0.5:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

You can run the `docker info` command to verify that **node1** was successfully configured as a swarm manager node.

```bash
docker info
```

```

The swarm is now initialized with **node1** as the only Manager node. In the next section you will add **node2** and **node3** as _Worker nodes_.
