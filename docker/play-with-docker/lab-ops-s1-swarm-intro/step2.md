# The application

The voting app is a multi-container application often used for demo purposes during Docker meetups and conferences. It basically allow users to vote between two choices, the default being "cat" and "dog", but could be "space" or "tab", too, if you feel like it. This application is available on Github and updated very frequently when new features are developed.
