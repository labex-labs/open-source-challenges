If you already have experience running containers and basic Docker commands you can probably skip this intro exercise.Concepts in this exercise:

- Docker engine
- Containers & images

Code snippets are shown in one of three ways throughout this environment:

1. Code that looks like `this` is sample code snippets that is usually part of an explanation.
2. Code that appears in box like the one below can be clicked on and it will automatically be typed in to the appropriate terminal window:

```bash
