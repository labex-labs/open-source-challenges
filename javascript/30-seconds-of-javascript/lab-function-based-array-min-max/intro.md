# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to find the minimum and maximum values of an array based on a provided function. We will use the `reduce()` method in combination with a comparator function to return the appropriate element in the array. By the end of the lab, you will have a good understanding of how to use this method to find the minimum and maximum values in an array based on your custom comparator function.
