# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the `compactJoin` function in JavaScript. This function allows you to remove falsy values from an array and join the remaining values into a string. You will learn how to implement this function using `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.join()`. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
