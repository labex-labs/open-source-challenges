# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a common programming problem of checking if a collection or object is empty in JavaScript. We will use a simple function to determine if the provided value is an empty object/collection, has no enumerable properties, or is any type that is not considered a collection. This lab will help you understand how to efficiently check for empty objects or collections in your JavaScript code.
