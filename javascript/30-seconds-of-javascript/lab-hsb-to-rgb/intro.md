# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the HSB to RGB color conversion process using JavaScript. We will learn how to convert HSB color values to RGB format using a formula and convert the output to the appropriate range of values. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of color models and how to work with them in JavaScript.
