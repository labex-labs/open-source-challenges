# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to add minutes to a given date in JavaScript. The `addMinutesToDate` function uses the `Date` constructor and various `Date` methods to create a new date object with a specified number of minutes added to it. This lab will help you understand how to manipulate dates in JavaScript and provide a useful utility function for your future projects.
