# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `matches` function in JavaScript to compare two objects and determine if they have equivalent property values. This function can be useful in scenarios where you need to check if two objects have the same properties and values, such as when validating user input or comparing data from different sources. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use the `matches` function and how it can simplify your coding tasks.
