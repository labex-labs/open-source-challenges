# Introduction

In this lab, we will be working on a JavaScript programming challenge that involves manipulating arrays. The goal of this lab is to write a function that removes elements from the end of an array until a specific condition is met, and returns the removed elements. You will be using various JavaScript array methods and a callback function to complete this challenge.
