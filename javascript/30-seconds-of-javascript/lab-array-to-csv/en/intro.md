# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use JavaScript to convert a 2D array to a comma-separated values (CSV) string. The lab will guide you through the process of using `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.join()` to create a CSV string from a 2D array. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to convert arrays into CSV strings using JavaScript.
