# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore JavaScript programming concepts through hands-on exercises. The lab is designed to help participants build a solid understanding of core JavaScript concepts such as functions, arrays, objects, and loops. Through a series of challenges and projects, participants will have the opportunity to apply what they learn and build their confidence as JavaScript developers.
