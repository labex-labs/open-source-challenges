# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to iterate over an object's own properties in reverse order using JavaScript. We will use built-in methods such as `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.reverse()` to achieve this. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with objects in JavaScript and how to manipulate their properties.
