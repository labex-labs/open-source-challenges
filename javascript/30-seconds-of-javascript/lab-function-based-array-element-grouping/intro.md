# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to group elements of an array based on a given function using JavaScript. We will make use of `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to create an object where the keys are produced from the mapped results. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to group and categorize data in JavaScript.
