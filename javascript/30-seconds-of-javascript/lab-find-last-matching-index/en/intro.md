# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of finding the last matching index of an element in an array using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.filter()` methods to filter out the elements for which the provided function returns falsy values, and `Array.prototype.pop()` to get the last element in the filtered array. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently find the last matching index of an element in an array using JavaScript.
