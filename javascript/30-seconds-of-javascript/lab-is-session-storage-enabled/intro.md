# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if `sessionStorage` is enabled in a browser. We will use a `try...catch` block to test if all operations complete successfully and then use `Storage.setItem()` and `Storage.removeItem()` to store and delete a value in `Window.sessionStorage`. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to detect if `sessionStorage` is available in a web browser using JavaScript.
