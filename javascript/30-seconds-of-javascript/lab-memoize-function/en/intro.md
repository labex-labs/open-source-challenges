# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of memoization in JavaScript. Memoization is a technique used to optimize function performance by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Through this lab, we will learn how to implement memoization in JavaScript using the `Map` object.
