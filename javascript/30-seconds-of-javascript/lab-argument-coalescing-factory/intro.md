# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to customize a coalesce function that returns the first argument which is `true` based on the given validator. We will learn to use `Array.prototype.find()` to return the first argument that returns `true` from the provided argument validation function, `valid`. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a custom coalesce function that can be used to return the first valid argument from a list of arguments.
