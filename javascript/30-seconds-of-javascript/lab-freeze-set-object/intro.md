# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a frozen `Set` object in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to understand how to prevent modifications to a `Set` object by setting its `add`, `delete`, and `clear` methods to `undefined`. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to create a frozen `Set` object and why it can be useful in certain scenarios.
