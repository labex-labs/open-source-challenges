# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to get nested values in JavaScript objects using a function called `dig`. This function can be used to retrieve a specific value from a complex nested object, making it easier to access the necessary information. Through this lab, you will learn how to use the `in` operator and the `reduce()` method to traverse through nested objects and find the target value.
