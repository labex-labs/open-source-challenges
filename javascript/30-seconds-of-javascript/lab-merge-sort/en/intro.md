In this lab, we will be exploring the Merge Sort algorithm in JavaScript. Merge Sort is a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that is efficient and commonly used in practice. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how Merge Sort works and how to implement it in your own JavaScript projects.
