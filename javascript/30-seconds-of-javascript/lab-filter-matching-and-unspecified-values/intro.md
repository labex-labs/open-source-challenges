# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore JavaScript programming and learn how to use the `Array.prototype.reduce()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`, and `Array.prototype.map()` methods together to create a function that filters an array of objects based on a condition and also filters out unspecified keys. This lab will help improve our understanding of functional programming in JavaScript and how to manipulate arrays of objects in a concise and efficient manner.
