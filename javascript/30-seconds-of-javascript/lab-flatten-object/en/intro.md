# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that flattens an object with the paths for keys. The function uses recursion and `Object.keys()` combined with `Array.prototype.reduce()` to convert every leaf node to a flattened path node. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate JavaScript objects and flatten them for easier data processing.
