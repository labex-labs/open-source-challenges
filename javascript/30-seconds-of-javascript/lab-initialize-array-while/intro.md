# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of initializing and filling an array with values generated by a function, while a specified condition is met. We will use the `initializeArrayWhile` function which takes two functions as arguments, a condition function and a mapping function. This lab will help you understand how to create a customized array based on a specific condition and mapping function.
