# Introduction

In this lab, we will be working on a JavaScript programming exercise aimed at combining two arrays of objects based on a specified property. The purpose of this exercise is to help you practice using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method and object manipulation in JavaScript, which are essential skills for any developer working with JavaScript. By the end of this lab, you should be able to seamlessly combine two arrays of objects based on a property to create a new array.
