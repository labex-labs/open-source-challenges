# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that converts an `rgb()` color string to an object with the values of each color. This function uses a combination of string manipulation and array destructuring to parse the numeric values from the input string and store them in a new object. This lab will help you understand how to work with strings, arrays, and objects in JavaScript.
