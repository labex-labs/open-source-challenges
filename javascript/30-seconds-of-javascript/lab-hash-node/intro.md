# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a SHA-256 hash using Node.js. The SHA-256 algorithm is commonly used to create secure digital signatures and to verify the integrity of data. With the help of the `crypto` module in Node.js, we will create a function that can take any value and return its SHA-256 hash as a promise.
