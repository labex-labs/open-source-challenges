# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `unfold()` function in JavaScript. This function allows us to create an array by repeatedly calling an iterator function with an initial seed value until the function returns `false`. Through this lab, we will learn how to use the `unfold()` function and how it can be used to simplify certain programming tasks.
