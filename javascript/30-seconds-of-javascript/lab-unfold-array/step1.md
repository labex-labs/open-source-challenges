# Revised Unfold Array

To create an array using an iterator function and an initial seed value, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use a `while` loop and `Array.prototype.push()` to call the iterator function repeatedly until it returns `false`.
3. The iterator function should accept one argument (`seed`) and always return an array with two elements ([`value`, `nextSeed`]) or `false` to terminate.

Use the following code to implement the `unfold` function:

```js
const unfold = (fn, seed) => {
  let result = [],
    val = [null, seed];
  while ((val = fn(val[1]))) result.push(val[0]);
  return result;
};
```

Here's an example of how to use the `unfold` function:

```js
var f = (n) => (n > 50 ? false : [-n, n + 10]);
unfold(f, 10); // [-10, -20, -30, -40, -50]
```

This will produce an array with values generated by the iterator function `f` starting from the initial seed value of `10`. The iterator function generates an array with two elements at each step: the negation of the current seed value and the next seed value, which is incremented by 10. The process continues until the seed value is greater than 50, at which point the function returns `false`.
