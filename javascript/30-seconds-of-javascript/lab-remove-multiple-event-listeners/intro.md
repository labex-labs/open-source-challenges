# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to detach an event listener from multiple targets in JavaScript. You will learn how to use the `removeEventListenerAll()` function to detach a given event listener for a specific event type from an array of targets. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to efficiently remove event listeners from multiple elements on a web page.
