# Introduction

In this lab, we will be learning about `HTTP PUT` requests in JavaScript. You will learn how to make a `PUT` request to a given URL using the `XMLHttpRequest` web API, set request headers, handle `onload` and `onerror` events, and log requests to the console. This lab will help you gain a better understanding of how to manipulate data using `PUT` requests and handle potential errors.
