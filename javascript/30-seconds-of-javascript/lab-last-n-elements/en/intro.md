# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `lastN` function which is used to extract the last `n` elements of an array. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.slice()` method to achieve this and see how it can be implemented in our JavaScript programs. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript and extract specific elements from them.
