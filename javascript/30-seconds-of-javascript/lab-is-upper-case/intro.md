# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a given string is in uppercase using JavaScript. We will create a function that converts the string to uppercase using the `String.prototype.toUpperCase()` method, and then compare it to the original string. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of string manipulation in JavaScript and how to check for uppercase strings.
