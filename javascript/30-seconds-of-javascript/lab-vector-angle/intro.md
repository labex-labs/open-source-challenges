# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of vector angle and learn how to calculate the angle between two vectors using JavaScript. We will use various mathematical functions such as `Math.pow()`, `Math.sqrt()`, and `Math.acos()` to perform the necessary calculations and derive the desired result. Through this lab, we will gain a better understanding of vector operations and their practical applications.
