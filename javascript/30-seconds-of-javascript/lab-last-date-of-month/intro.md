# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `Date` object in JavaScript to find the last date of a given month. We will learn how to extract the year and month from a date, create a new date object with the last day of the previous month, and format the result as a string representation of the date. This lab will help you develop your understanding of the JavaScript `Date` object and its properties.
