# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a `Map` to an object in JavaScript. We will use the `Map.prototype.entries()` method to get an array of key-value pairs from the `Map` and then use `Object.fromEntries()` to convert the array to an object. This lab will provide a better understanding of the use of `Map` and `Object` in JavaScript.
