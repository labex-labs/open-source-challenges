# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a string into a URL-friendly slug using JavaScript. The process involves normalizing the string by converting it to lowercase and removing special characters, followed by replacing spaces, dashes, and underscores with hyphens. By the end of this lab, you will have a function that can generate a slug from any given string, making it easier to use in URLs and other web-based applications.
