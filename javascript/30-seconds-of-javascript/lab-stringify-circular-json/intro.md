# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to serialize a JSON object that contains circular references using JavaScript. We will use a custom replacer function and a `WeakSet` to detect and omit circular references. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to handle circular data structures in JavaScript and how to serialize them into JSON format.
