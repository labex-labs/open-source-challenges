# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that filters non-unique array values based on a provided comparator function. By using `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.every()`, we will create a new array that contains only the unique values based on the comparator function. This lab aims to improve your understanding of JavaScript array methods and how to use them to manipulate data.
