# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to initialize and fill an array with specific values in JavaScript. We will use the `Array()` constructor and the `Array.prototype.fill()` method to create and populate the array. By the end of the lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to create and manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
