# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of object equality in JavaScript. We will learn how to perform a deep comparison between two values to determine if they are equivalent using various techniques, such as checking if the values are identical, checking if they are non-object values with an equivalent value, and using `Object.keys()` to check if both values have the same number of keys. We will also understand how to use recursion to compare nested objects.
