# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to remove elements from an array in JavaScript without modifying the original array. We will use a custom function called `shank` that mimics the behavior of the `Array.prototype.splice()` method, but returns a new array instead of altering the existing one. Through this lab, we will learn how to efficiently remove and add elements to an array in different scenarios.
