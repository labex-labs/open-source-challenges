# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `deepMapKeys` function in JavaScript to map an object's keys recursively. We will learn how to create a new object with the same values and mapped keys using a provided function for each key. Through hands-on exercises and examples, we will understand how this function works and how it can be used in practical scenarios.
