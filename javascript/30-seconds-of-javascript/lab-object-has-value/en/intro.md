# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if an object has a specific value using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Object.values()` method to extract all the values of an object and how to use the `Array.prototype.includes()` method to check if a target value exists in the array of values. This knowledge will help us efficiently check for values in JSON objects in our JavaScript projects.
