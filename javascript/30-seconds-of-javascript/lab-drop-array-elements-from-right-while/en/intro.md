# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to remove elements from the end of an array based on a specified function. The `dropRightWhile` function will loop through the array and remove elements from the right until the function returns `true`. The remaining elements of the array will then be returned. This lab will help you understand how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript using higher-order functions.
