# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to initialize a 2D array in JavaScript. We will use the `Array.from()` and `Array.prototype.map()` methods to create an array of given width and height, and fill it with a specified value. This lab will provide a hands-on experience of working with 2D arrays and understanding their implementation in JavaScript.
