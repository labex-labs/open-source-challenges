# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of generators in JavaScript and learn how to create a cycle generator that loops over an array indefinitely. We will use the `yield` keyword and a `while` loop to create the generator, and then test it with different arrays to see how it works. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of generators and how they can be used in your JavaScript projects.
