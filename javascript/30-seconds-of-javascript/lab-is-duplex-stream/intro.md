# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to determine whether a given argument is a duplex (readable and writable) stream in JavaScript. We will use a combination of `typeof` checks and property validations to create a function that can accurately identify duplex streams. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how streams work in JavaScript and how to work with them in your own code.
