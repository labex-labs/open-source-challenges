# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if one array is contained in another array in JavaScript. We will use various array methods such as `for...of`, `Set`, `some()`, and `filter()` to write a function that can determine if the elements of the first array are present in the second array, regardless of their order. This lab will help you understand how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript and write efficient code to solve common programming problems.
