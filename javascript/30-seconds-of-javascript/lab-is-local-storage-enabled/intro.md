# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if `localStorage` is enabled in a web browser using JavaScript. `localStorage` is a useful feature that allows web developers to store data on a user's computer, but it may not always be available due to browser settings or other factors. By using a `try...catch` block and `Storage.setItem()` and `Storage.removeItem()` methods, we can determine whether `localStorage` is accessible and take appropriate action in our web applications.
