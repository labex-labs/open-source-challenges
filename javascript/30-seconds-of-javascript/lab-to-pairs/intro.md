# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring a JavaScript function called "toPairs", which creates an array of key-value pair arrays from an object or other iterable. Through this lab, we will learn how to use this function to convert various data structures into a format that is more easily manipulated and accessed. We will also gain a deeper understanding of the concepts of iterators and iterable objects in JavaScript.
