# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of omitting object keys based on a given condition using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `omitBy()` function to filter out keys from an object based on a provided function. Through practical examples, we will understand how this function can be useful in simplifying our code and making it more efficient.
