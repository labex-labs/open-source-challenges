# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert comma-separated values (CSV) data into a 2D array using JavaScript. We will use the `CSVToArray()` function which takes a CSV string as input and converts it into an array of arrays. This lab will help you understand how to work with CSV data and manipulate it using JavaScript.
