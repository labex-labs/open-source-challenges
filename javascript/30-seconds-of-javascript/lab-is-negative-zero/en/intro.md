# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to determine whether a given number is a negative zero or not, using JavaScript. We will use a simple function that checks if the value is equal to zero and if 1 divided by the value equals -Infinity. This lab will help you understand the concept of negative zero in JavaScript and how to detect it in your code.
