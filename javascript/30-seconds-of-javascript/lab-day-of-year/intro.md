# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to calculate the day of the year in JavaScript using the `Date` object. By utilizing the `Date` constructor and `Date.prototype.getFullYear()`, we will create a function that returns the current day of the year as a number ranging from 1 to 366. This lab is designed to help you enhance your JavaScript skills and improve your understanding of date manipulation in JavaScript.
