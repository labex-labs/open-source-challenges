# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to remove elements from the end of an array in JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.slice()` method to create a new array with `n` elements taken from the end of the original array. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
