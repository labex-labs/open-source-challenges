# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the world of JavaScript programming and explore the concept of calculating the average of numbers. Through hands-on exercises, you will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method and how to write a function to calculate the average of any number of values. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use JavaScript to perform mathematical operations on arrays of numbers.
