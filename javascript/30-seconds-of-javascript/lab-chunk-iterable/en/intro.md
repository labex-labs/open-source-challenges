# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of chunking an iterable into smaller arrays of a specified size using JavaScript. We will implement a function that takes in an iterable and a size parameter and returns an iterable of smaller arrays that contain a maximum of size elements each. This technique can be useful for various applications, such as breaking down large datasets into smaller chunks for processing or optimizing network requests by reducing the amount of data transferred at once.
