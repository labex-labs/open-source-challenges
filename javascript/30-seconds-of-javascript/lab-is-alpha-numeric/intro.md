# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a given string contains only alphanumeric characters using JavaScript. We will use a regular expression pattern to match the input string against alphanumeric characters and return a boolean value indicating whether the string is alphanumeric or not. This lab will help you understand how to work with regular expressions in JavaScript and how to use them to solve practical problems.
