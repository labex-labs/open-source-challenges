# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of Hamming Distance and how it is calculated in JavaScript. Through hands-on exercises and coding challenges, you will learn how to use the XOR operator and string manipulation methods to determine the bit difference between two numbers. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of the Hamming Distance algorithm and be able to implement it in your own JavaScript programs.
