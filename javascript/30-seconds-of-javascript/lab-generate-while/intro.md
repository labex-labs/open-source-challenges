# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a generator function in JavaScript that produces new values while a given condition is met. We will use the `generateWhile` function which takes in a seed value, a condition function, and a next function to calculate the next value from the current value and the next seed. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create custom generators that can be used to produce values based on specific conditions and rules.
