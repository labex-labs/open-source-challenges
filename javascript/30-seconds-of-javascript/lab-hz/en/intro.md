# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into measuring the performance of JavaScript functions using the concept of Hertz frequency. We will learn how to use the `performance.now()` method to calculate the time elapsed executing a function and how to determine the number of cycles per second. Through practical examples and exercises, we will explore the differences in performance between different implementations of the same function.
