# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking if a given string is in lowercase or not using JavaScript. We will learn about the `String.prototype.toLowerCase()` method, which is used to convert a given string to lowercase. By the end of this lab, you will be able to write a function that checks if a string is in lowercase or not.
