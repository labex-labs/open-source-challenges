# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert an object to a `Map` in JavaScript. We will use the `Object.entries()` method to convert the object to an array of key-value pairs, and then use the `Map` constructor to convert the array to a `Map`. This technique can be useful when working with data that requires the use of a `Map` data structure.
