# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript by creating a function that returns all the elements of an array except the last one. We will use the `Array.prototype.slice()` method to achieve this and learn how to slice and extract elements from arrays. This lab will help us understand the fundamentals of working with arrays in JavaScript.
