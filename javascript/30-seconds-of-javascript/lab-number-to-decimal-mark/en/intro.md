# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `Number` object in JavaScript and learn how to convert a number to a decimal mark formatted string. We will use the `toLocaleString()` method to achieve this. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to format numbers in a readable and user-friendly way.
