# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the k-means clustering algorithm in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to learn how to group data into k clusters based on similarity, using the k-means algorithm. We will implement the algorithm step-by-step and apply it to a sample dataset to understand how it works.
