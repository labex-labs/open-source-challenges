# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking if an array has many matches using JavaScript. You will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.filter()` method in combination with a given function to find all matching array elements and then check if there are more than one such elements using the `Array.prototype.length` property. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
