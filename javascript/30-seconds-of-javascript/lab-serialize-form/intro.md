# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use JavaScript to encode a set of form elements as a query string. We will create a function called `serializeForm` that takes in a `form` element and converts it to a `FormData` object. We will then use various array methods to encode each field's value and produce an appropriate query string. This lab will help us understand how to handle form data and make HTTP requests with encoded data.
