# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to handle click events that occur outside a specific element on a web page using JavaScript. We will create a function that listens for 'click' events on the document and checks if the clicked element is a descendant of the specified element. If not, a callback function is executed. This technique is useful for implementing features such as closing a dropdown menu or a modal when a user clicks outside of it.
