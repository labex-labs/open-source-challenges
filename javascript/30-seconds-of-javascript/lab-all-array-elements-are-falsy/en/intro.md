# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of testing whether all elements in an array are falsy using JavaScript. We will use the `none()` function which checks if the provided predicate function returns `false` for all elements in a collection. Through practical examples, we will see how this function can be used to efficiently manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
