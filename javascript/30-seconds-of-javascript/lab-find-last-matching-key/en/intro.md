# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function called `findLastKey()` that helps us find the last key in an object that matches a given condition. We'll learn how to use `Object.keys()`, `Array.prototype.reverse()`, and `Array.prototype.find()` to implement this function and see how it can be used to simplify our code when working with objects. By the end of this lab, you'll have a better understanding of how to work with JavaScript objects and how to use the `findLastKey()` function to make your code more concise and efficient.
