  "description": "In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the difference between two dates in seconds using JavaScript. The lab will provide a function that takes two `Date` objects as input and returns the difference between them in seconds. This can be useful in various applications, such as measuring time intervals or calculating the duration between two events. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with dates in JavaScript and how to perform time calculations using built-in methods.",
