# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to map the keys of an object using a provided function, generating a new object. We will use `Object.keys()` to iterate over the object's keys and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to create a new object with the same values and mapped keys using the provided function. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to transform an object's keys using JavaScript.
