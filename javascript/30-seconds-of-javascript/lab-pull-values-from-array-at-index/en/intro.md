# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to pull values from an array at specific indexes using JavaScript. We will be using the `pullAtIndex()` function, which mutates the original array to filter out the values at the specified indexes and returns the removed elements. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
