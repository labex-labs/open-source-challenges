# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the concept of disjointed iterables in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Set` constructor and `Array.prototype.every()` method to check if two iterables have any common values. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement this functionality in your JavaScript code.
