# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, including variables, data types, and functions. Through a series of exercises and challenges, you will gain hands-on experience with JavaScript syntax and learn how to write efficient, effective code. By the end of the lab, you will be well-equipped to tackle more complex programming tasks and build your own JavaScript applications.
