# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to toggle an element in an array using JavaScript. The toggleElement() function allows you to remove an element from an array if it's already included in it or add the element to the array if it's not already present. This lab will help you understand how to use the includes() and filter() methods in combination with the spread operator to efficiently toggle array elements.
