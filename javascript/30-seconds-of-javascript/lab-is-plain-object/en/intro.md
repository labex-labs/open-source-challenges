# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking whether a given value is a plain object or not using JavaScript. We will use the `isPlainObject()` function to check if the provided value is an object created by the Object constructor. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to determine if an object is plain or not in JavaScript.
