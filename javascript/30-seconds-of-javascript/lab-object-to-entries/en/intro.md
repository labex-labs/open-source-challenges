# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create an array of key-value pair arrays from an object in JavaScript. The lab will provide step-by-step guidance on how to use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.map()` to iterate over an object's keys and produce an array of key-value pairs. We will also learn about the built-in `Object.entries()` method that provides similar functionality.
