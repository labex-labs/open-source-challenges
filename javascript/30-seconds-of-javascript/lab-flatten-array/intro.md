# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of flattening an array up to a specified depth using JavaScript. We will learn how to use recursion, reduce, and concat methods to merge elements or arrays. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently flatten arrays and manipulate nested data structures in JavaScript.
