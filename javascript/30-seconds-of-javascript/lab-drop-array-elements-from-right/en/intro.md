# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to drop array elements from the right using JavaScript. We will create a function that takes an array and a number as arguments and returns a new array with the specified number of elements removed from the right. We will use the `Array.prototype.slice()` method to achieve this functionality and also learn how to set a default value for the second argument of the function.
