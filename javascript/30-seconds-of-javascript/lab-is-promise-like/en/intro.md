# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of Promises in JavaScript and learn how to identify if an object is Promise-like using the `isPromiseLike` function. Through practical examples, we will understand how Promises work and how to leverage them for asynchronous programming. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of Promises and how to identify them in your code.
