# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of standard deviation in statistics and its implementation in JavaScript. We will learn how to calculate the standard deviation of an array of numbers using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method and understand the difference between sample and population standard deviation. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of statistical analysis and how to apply it in JavaScript programming.
