# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to normalize line endings in a string using JavaScript. We will use the `String.prototype.replace()` method along with a regular expression to match and replace line endings with the normalized version. Additionally, we will learn how to omit the second argument to use the default value and see examples of how the function works in practice.
