# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the topic of generating random alphanumeric strings using JavaScript. We will learn how to create a function that generates a random string of a specified length by utilizing various JavaScript methods, such as `Array.from()`, `Math.random()`, `Number.prototype.toString()`, and `String.prototype.slice()`. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to generate random strings in JavaScript and how to use these methods to build more complex applications.
