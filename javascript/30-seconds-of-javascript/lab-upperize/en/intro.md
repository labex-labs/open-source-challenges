# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert all the keys of an object to uppercase in JavaScript. You will learn how to use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to create a new object with all the keys converted to uppercase letters. This technique can be useful in various scenarios where you need to standardize the keys of an object for consistency and ease of use.
