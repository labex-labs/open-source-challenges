# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a given string is an anagram of another string. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as "iceman" and "cinema". We will use JavaScript to create a function that takes two strings as arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether they are anagrams of each other or not.
