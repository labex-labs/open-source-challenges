# Introduction

In this lab, we will be working with JavaScript to create an event hub using the publish-subscribe pattern. The event hub will have methods such as `emit`, `on`, and `off` to allow for subscribing to and emitting events. This lab will provide hands-on experience in building a powerful tool that can be used to manage complex events in JavaScript applications.
