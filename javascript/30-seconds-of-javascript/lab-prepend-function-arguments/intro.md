# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of function partials in JavaScript and learn how to create a higher-order function that allows us to easily prepend arguments to a given function. Through practical examples and exercises, we will understand how partial functions work and how they can be used to simplify our code and make it more modular.
