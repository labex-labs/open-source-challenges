# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a function that binds a given context to another function. The `bind()` function allows us to easily set the value of `this` within a function to a specific object, which can be useful in certain scenarios. We will learn how to use the spread operator to pass additional arguments to the bound function as well.
