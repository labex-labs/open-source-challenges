# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to convert an `hsl()` color string to an array of values using JavaScript. We will be using a combination of regular expressions and array methods to extract the numeric values from the string and convert them into an array of numeric values. This lab will help you understand how to work with color values in JavaScript and improve your skills with regular expressions and array manipulation.
