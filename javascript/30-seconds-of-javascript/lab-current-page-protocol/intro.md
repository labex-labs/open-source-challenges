# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use JavaScript to manipulate the current page's protocol. By using the `Window.location.protocol` property, we can easily retrieve the protocol (`http:` or `https:`) of the current page. This lab will provide hands-on experience on how to use this property and its implementation in real-world scenarios.
