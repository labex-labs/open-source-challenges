# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `replaceLast` function in JavaScript, which replaces the last occurrence of a pattern in a given string with a specified replacement. This lab will guide you through the implementation of the `replaceLast` function, which will enable you to manipulate strings in a more efficient and flexible manner. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to replace the last occurrence of a pattern in a string and will be able to apply this knowledge to your future programming projects.
