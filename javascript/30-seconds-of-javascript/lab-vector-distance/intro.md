# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the world of JavaScript programming and explore the concept of vector distance. The purpose of the lab is to help you understand how to use `Array.prototype.reduce()`, `Math.pow()`, and `Math.sqrt()` to calculate the Euclidean distance between two vectors. By the end of the lab, you will have gained practical experience in implementing this useful function in JavaScript.
