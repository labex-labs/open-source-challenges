# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to find all the keys in a JavaScript object that match a given value. By using `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.filter()`, we can efficiently search through an object and return an array of keys that correspond to the provided value. This will be a valuable skill for any JavaScript developer working with complex data structures.
