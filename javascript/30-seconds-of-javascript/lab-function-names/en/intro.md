# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use JavaScript to get an array of function property names from an object's own enumerable properties. We will learn how to iterate over an object's properties and use `Object.keys()` and `Object.getPrototypeOf()` to include inherited properties if needed. We will also filter out non-function properties using `Array.prototype.filter()`.
