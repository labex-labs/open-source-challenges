# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create an object from key-value pairs in JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to combine the pairs into a single object. Additionally, we will learn about the `Object.fromEntries()` method, which provides similar functionality. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with key-value pairs in JavaScript.
