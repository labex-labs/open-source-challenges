# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to generate Gaussian random numbers using the Box-Muller transform in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to provide a hands-on experience in understanding and implementing a commonly used technique for generating normally distributed random numbers. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to generate Gaussian random numbers and how they can be used in various applications.
