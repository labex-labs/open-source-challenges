  "description": "In this lab, we will dive into the world of JavaScript programming and learn how to create a function that checks if a number is divisible by another number. Through this lab, you will gain a deeper understanding of the modulo operator and how it can be used to perform calculations in JavaScript. By the end of this lab, you will have a functional and efficient solution to determine if one number is divisible by another.",
