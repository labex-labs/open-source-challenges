# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of generators in JavaScript. Specifically, we will learn how to create a generator function that produces new values until a certain condition is met. Through hands-on coding exercises, we will gain a better understanding of how generators work and how they can be used to simplify our code and improve its performance.
