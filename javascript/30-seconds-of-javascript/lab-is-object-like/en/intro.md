# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to check if a value is object-like using JavaScript. We will be using the `isObjectLike` function to determine if a given value is an object or array, and we will also learn how to differentiate it from other data types such as null or functions. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of object-like values and how to work with them in your JavaScript code.
