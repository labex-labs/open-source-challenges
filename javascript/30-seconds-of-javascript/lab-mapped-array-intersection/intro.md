# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of array intersection in JavaScript. Specifically, we will be implementing a function that returns the common elements between two arrays, after applying a provided function to each element of both arrays. This lab will help you understand how to use higher-order functions in JavaScript to manipulate arrays and solve common programming problems.
