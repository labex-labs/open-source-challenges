# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to measure the time taken by a function to execute using JavaScript. We will use the `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` methods to measure the difference between the start and end times of a function and determine how long it took to execute. This skill is useful for optimizing code and improving performance in web development.
