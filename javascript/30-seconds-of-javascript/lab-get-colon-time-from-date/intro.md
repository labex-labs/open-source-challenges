# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to extract the time from a `Date` object and format it as a string in the `HH:MM:SS` format. We will use the `Date.prototype.toTimeString()` method to convert the `Date` object to a string, and then use `String.prototype.slice()` to extract the `HH:MM:SS` part of the string. This lab will help you understand how to work with `Date` objects in JavaScript and format them as needed.
