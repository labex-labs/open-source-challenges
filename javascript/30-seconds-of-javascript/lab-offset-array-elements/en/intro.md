# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore an interesting JavaScript function that allows us to offset array elements by a specified amount. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.slice()` method and the spread operator to move elements either from start to end or end to start of the array based on the value of the offset. This lab is designed to help JavaScript developers improve their understanding of manipulating arrays.
