# How to Offset Array Elements in JavaScript

To move a specified number of elements to the end of a JavaScript array, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use the `Array.prototype.slice()` method twice to get the elements after the specified index and the elements before that.
3. Use the spread operator (`...`) to combine the two arrays into one.
4. If the `offset` is negative, the elements will be moved from the end to the start of the array.

Here's an example code snippet that implements the `offset` function:

```js
const offset = (arr, offset) => [...arr.slice(offset), ...arr.slice(0, offset)];
```

You can then call the function with your desired array and offset values:

```js
offset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2); // [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
offset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], -2); // [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
