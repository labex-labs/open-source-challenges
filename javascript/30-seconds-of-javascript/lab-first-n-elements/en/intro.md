# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use JavaScript to manipulate arrays and extract the first n elements of an array. We will use the `slice()` method to extract a portion of an array and return a new array with the extracted elements. Through this lab, you will learn how to implement the `firstN` function that extracts the first n elements of an array.
