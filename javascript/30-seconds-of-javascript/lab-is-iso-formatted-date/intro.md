# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to determine if a given string is a valid date string in the simplified extended ISO format (ISO 8601). We will use the `Date` constructor and its associated methods to create a `Date` object from the string and check its validity. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with dates in JavaScript and how to validate them using the ISO format.
