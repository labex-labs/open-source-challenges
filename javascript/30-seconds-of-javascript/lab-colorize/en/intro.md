# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to add color to text output in the console using special characters in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `colorize` function to apply different text and background colors to our console output, making it more visually appealing and easier to read. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create colorful and eye-catching console output in your JavaScript applications.
