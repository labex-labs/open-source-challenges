# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that takes a number and returns it as a string with the correct ordinal indicator suffix. The function will use the modulo operator to find values of single and tens digits, and then determine which ordinal pattern digits match. We will also handle the special case of teens pattern digits and use the appropriate ordinal for these numbers.
