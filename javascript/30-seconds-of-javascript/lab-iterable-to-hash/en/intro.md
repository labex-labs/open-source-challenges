# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `Iterable to Hash` method in JavaScript. This method allows us to convert a given iterable (object or array) into a value hash, which can be useful for organizing and accessing data in a more efficient way. We will learn how to use `Object.values()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to create an object that is keyed by the reference value of the iterable.
