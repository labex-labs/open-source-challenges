# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to convert all the keys of an object to lowercase using JavaScript. We will use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to map the keys to an object and `String.prototype.toLowerCase()` to convert them to lowercase. This technique can be useful when dealing with objects that have inconsistent key casing.
