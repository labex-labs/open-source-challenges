# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring a JavaScript function that helps us find the common keys between two objects. We will use the `Object.keys()` method to get the keys of the first object, and then check if the second object has a key that matches using `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()`. Finally, we will use `Array.prototype.filter()` to filter out the keys that are not common to both objects. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to efficiently find common keys between two objects in JavaScript.
