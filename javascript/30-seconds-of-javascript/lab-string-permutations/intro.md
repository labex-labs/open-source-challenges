# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of string permutations in JavaScript. We will use recursion to generate all possible permutations of a given string, including duplicates. We will also discuss the use of `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` methods to simplify the code and combine the different permutations.
