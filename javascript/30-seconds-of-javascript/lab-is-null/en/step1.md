# Checking if a Value is Null

To check if a value is `null` in JavaScript, use the strict equality operator (`===`). Here's an example code snippet that defines a function called `isNull` which returns `true` if the given value is `null` and `false` otherwise.

```js
const isNull = (val) => val === null;
```

To test this function, you can call it with the value you want to check as its argument. For example, `isNull(null)` will return `true`.
