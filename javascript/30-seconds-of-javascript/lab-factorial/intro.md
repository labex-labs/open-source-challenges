# Introduction

In this lab, we will be learning how to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion in JavaScript. We will also learn how to throw a `TypeError` if the input is a negative number. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of recursion and how it can be used to solve mathematical problems.
