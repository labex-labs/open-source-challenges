# Introduction

In this lab, we will be working on a JavaScript programming exercise that involves extracting values from an array of objects. Specifically, we will be writing a function that takes in an array of objects and a key and returns an array of values corresponding to that key. This exercise will help improve your understanding of functional programming concepts and array manipulation in JavaScript.
