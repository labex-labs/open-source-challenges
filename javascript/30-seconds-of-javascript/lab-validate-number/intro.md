# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that checks whether a given value is a number. We will use the `parseFloat()` method to convert the value to a number and then validate it using `Number.isNaN()` and `Number.isFinite()`. We will also use coercion to check if the value is a number. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to validate numbers in JavaScript.
