# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of finding the last insertion index in a sorted array based on a provided iterator function, using JavaScript. The lab will cover how to check if an array is sorted in descending order, how to apply an iterator function to all elements of an array, and how to find the appropriate last index where an element should be inserted, based on the provided iterator function. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays and use iterator functions in JavaScript.
