# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to group elements of arrays based on their position and combine them using a function. We will use the `zipWith` function to achieve this, which creates an array of elements that are grouped based on their position in the original arrays. The `zipWith` function can be very useful when working with arrays of different lengths and we will see how to use it to handle such scenarios.
