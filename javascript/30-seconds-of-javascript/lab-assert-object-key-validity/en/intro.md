# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to validate all the keys in an object and ensure they match a given set of keys. We will make use of the `Object.keys()` method to get the keys of the object and then use `Array.prototype.every()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` to validate each key. This lab will help you to write more efficient and error-free code when working with objects in JavaScript.
