# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of array-like objects in JavaScript and learn how to determine whether an object is iterable. We will use the `isArrayLike` function to check if an object has an iterator and therefore can be iterated over using a `for...of` loop. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with array-like objects in JavaScript.
