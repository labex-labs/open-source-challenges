# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the `indexOfAll` function in JavaScript. This function allows us to find all indexes of a given value in an array. By using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method, we can easily loop over the elements of an array and store the indexes for matching elements. This lab will provide hands-on experience with this useful function and its implementation in JavaScript.
