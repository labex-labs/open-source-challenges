# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of argument coalescing in JavaScript. Argument coalescing is a technique used to return the first defined, non-null argument out of a list of arguments. Through practical examples, we will learn how to implement this technique using JavaScript's built-in methods such as `Array.prototype.find()` and `Array.prototype.includes()`.
