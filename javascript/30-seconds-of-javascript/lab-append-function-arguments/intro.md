# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `partialRight()` function in JavaScript to create new functions with pre-specified arguments. This powerful function allows us to easily append arguments to existing functions, enabling us to create new functions with specific behaviors without having to redefine the original function. We'll see examples of how to use `partialRight()` to streamline our code and make it more modular.
