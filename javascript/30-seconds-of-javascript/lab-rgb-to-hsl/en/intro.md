# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the conversion of RGB color tuples to the HSL format. We will use the RGB to HSL conversion formula and implement it using JavaScript. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to convert RGB colors to the HSL format and manipulate color values in your projects.
