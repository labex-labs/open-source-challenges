# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the date of `n` days from today using JavaScript. We will use the `Date` constructor, along with various date methods such as `getDate()` and `setDate()`, to manipulate dates and return a string representation of the calculated date in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with dates in JavaScript and be able to apply this knowledge to various projects.
