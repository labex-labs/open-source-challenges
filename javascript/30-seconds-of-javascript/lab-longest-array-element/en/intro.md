# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of finding the longest item in an array using JavaScript. We will use the `reduce()` method to compare the length of objects in an array and return the longest one. This lab will provide a practical understanding of how to work with arrays and higher-order functions in JavaScript.
