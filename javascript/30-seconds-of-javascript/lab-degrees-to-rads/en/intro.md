# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the conversion of angles from degrees to radians in JavaScript. We will use the degree to radian formula and the `Math.PI` constant to develop a function that can convert angles from degrees to radians. This lab will help you understand the concept of radians and how to perform mathematical calculations involving angles in JavaScript.
