# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a debounced function that returns a promise in JavaScript. We will learn how to delay invoking a function until a specified time has elapsed, and how to handle multiple promises returned during this time to ensure they all return the same data. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement debouncing with promises in your JavaScript projects.
