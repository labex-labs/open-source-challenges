# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to convert strings to camelcase using JavaScript. Camelcase is a naming convention used in programming where multi-word identifiers are written in a way that each word, except the first one, starts with a capital letter without any spaces or underscores between them. The `toCamelCase()` function provided in this lab uses regular expressions and array methods to convert strings to camelcase.
