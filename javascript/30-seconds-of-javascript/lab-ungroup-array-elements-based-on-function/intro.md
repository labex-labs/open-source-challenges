# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to ungroup array elements based on a provided function. We will use the `unzipWith()` function, which takes an array produced by the `zip()` function and applies the provided function to ungroup the elements. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays and perform custom operations on their elements.
