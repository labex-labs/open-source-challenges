# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of function composition in JavaScript. Specifically, we will focus on the `composeRight` function, which allows us to combine multiple functions into a single function that is executed from left to right. Through practical examples, we will see how function composition can simplify our code and make it more modular.
