# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of function currying and uncurrying in JavaScript. Function currying is a technique that allows us to transform a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. On the other hand, function uncurrying is the process of transforming a sequence of functions that each take a single argument into a function that takes multiple arguments. Through this lab, we will learn how to implement both these techniques in JavaScript.
