# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to filter an array's values based on a predicate function, returning only values for which the predicate function returns `false`. We will use `Array.prototype.filter()` in combination with the predicate function to achieve this. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to implement this technique in your JavaScript code.
