# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of function composition in asynchronous programming using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `pipeAsyncFunctions` function to compose a series of asynchronous functions that can accept a single argument and return a combination of normal values, `Promise`s, or be `async`. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use function composition to write more efficient and readable asynchronous code.
