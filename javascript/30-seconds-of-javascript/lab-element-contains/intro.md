# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to check if an HTML element contains another element using JavaScript. We will use the `Node.contains()` method to check if a parent element contains a child element and ensure that the parent and child elements are not the same. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to traverse the DOM and check for element relationships.
