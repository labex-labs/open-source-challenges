# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of pretty-printing numbers in bytes to a human-readable format using JavaScript. We will learn how to convert a given number of bytes into KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, and YB by using an array dictionary of units. With the help of the `Number.prototype.toPrecision()` method, we will truncate the number to a certain number of digits and build a prettified string to display the result.
