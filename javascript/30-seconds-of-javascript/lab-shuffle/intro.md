# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Fisher-Yates algorithm and its implementation in JavaScript. Specifically, we will be focusing on shuffling arrays using this algorithm. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how the Fisher-Yates algorithm works and how it can be used to randomize the order of elements in an array.
