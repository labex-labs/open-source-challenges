# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to check if an element is visible in the viewport using JavaScript. We will use the `getBoundingClientRect()` method along with `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight` properties to determine if an element is fully or partially visible. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a reusable function that can be used to enhance the user experience of your web applications.
