# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the world of JavaScript programming and explore the fundamentals of the language. We will learn about variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more. Through hands-on exercises and examples, we will gain a solid understanding of how to write and execute JavaScript code. By the end of the lab, you will have the foundational knowledge needed to start building your own JavaScript applications.
