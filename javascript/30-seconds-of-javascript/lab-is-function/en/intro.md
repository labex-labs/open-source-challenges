# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of functions in JavaScript. We will learn how to define and call functions, pass arguments, and return values. Additionally, we will practice using the `isFunction()` function to check if a given value is a function. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how functions work in JavaScript and how to use them effectively in your code.
