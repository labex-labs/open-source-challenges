# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of array intersection based on a provided comparator function in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to teach you how to use `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.findIndex()` to find intersecting values between two arrays. By the end of this lab, you will be able to apply this technique to your own projects and improve your programming skills in JavaScript.
