# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of "Unary Function Arity" in JavaScript. We will learn how to create a function that accepts only one argument and ignores any additional arguments. This lab will also demonstrate how to call the provided function with just the first argument supplied. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement this technique in your code to improve its efficiency and readability.
