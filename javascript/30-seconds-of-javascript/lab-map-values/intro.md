# Introduction

In this lab, we will be working on a JavaScript programming exercise that focuses on mapping the values of an object using a provided function. The purpose of this exercise is to help you gain a better understanding of how to use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to create a new object with the same keys and mapped values. By the end of this lab, you will be able to apply this knowledge to solve more complex problems in your own projects.
