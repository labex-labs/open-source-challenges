# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring a JavaScript function that checks if an array includes any values from another array. We will be using the `Array.prototype.some()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` methods to implement the `includesAny()` function. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to efficiently check for the presence of values in arrays using JavaScript.
