# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `XMLHttpRequest` web API and learn how to make a `DELETE` request to a given URL using JavaScript. We will create a function called `httpDelete` that takes in a URL, a callback function, and an optional error function as parameters. The function will use `XMLHttpRequest` to send a `DELETE` request to the provided URL and handle the response using the callback function.
