# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to trigger a specific event on an HTML element using JavaScript. The lab will guide you on how to use the `CustomEvent` constructor to create a custom event with specific details and how to use `EventTarget.dispatchEvent()` to trigger the event on a given element. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate events in the DOM using JavaScript.
