# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `pickBy()` function to create a new object composed of only the key-value pairs for which a given function returns truthy. This function can be useful in scenarios where you need to filter out certain properties from an object based on certain criteria. We will learn how to use `Object.keys()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`, and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to accomplish this task.
