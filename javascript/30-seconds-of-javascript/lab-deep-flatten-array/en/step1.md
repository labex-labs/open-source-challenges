# How to Deep Flatten an Array using Recursion in JavaScript

To deep flatten an array in JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use recursion to flatten the array.
3. Use the `Array.prototype.concat()` method with an empty array (`[]`) and the spread operator (`...`) to flatten the array.
4. Recursively flatten each element that is an array.
5. Implement the following code:

```js
const deepFlatten = (arr) =>
  [].concat(...arr.map((v) => (Array.isArray(v) ? deepFlatten(v) : v)));

deepFlatten([1, [2], [[3], 4], 5]); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

By following these steps, you can easily deep flatten an array using recursion in JavaScript.
