# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to decapitalize the first letter of a string in JavaScript using the `decapitalize` function. This function makes use of array destructuring and string manipulation methods to change the case of the first letter of a string. Additionally, we will see how to optionally convert the rest of the string to uppercase.
