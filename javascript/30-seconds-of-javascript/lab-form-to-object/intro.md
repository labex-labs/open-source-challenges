# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a set of form elements into an object using JavaScript. We will make use of the `FormData` constructor and the `Array.from()` method to create an array of form data. We will then use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to collect the form data into an object. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to collect and organize form data using JavaScript.
