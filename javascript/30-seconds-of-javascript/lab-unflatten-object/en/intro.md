# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to unflatten an object with paths for keys in JavaScript. We will use nested `Array.prototype.reduce()` and `String.prototype.split()` methods to split each key with a dot delimiter and add objects against the keys. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to efficiently convert a flat object to a nested one.
