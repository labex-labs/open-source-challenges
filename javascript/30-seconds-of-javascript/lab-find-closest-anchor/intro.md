# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to find the closest anchor node to a given node using JavaScript. We will use a `for` loop and the `Node.parentNode` property to traverse the node tree upwards, checking if each node is an anchor using `Node.nodeName` and `String.prototype.toLowerCase()`. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to locate and interact with specific elements in the DOM using JavaScript.
