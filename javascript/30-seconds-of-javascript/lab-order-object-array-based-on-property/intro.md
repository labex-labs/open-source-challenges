# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to order an array of objects based on a given property and a custom order array. We will be using a combination of `Array.prototype.reduce()` and `Array.prototype.sort()` to create a new array that is sorted based on the order provided in the `order` array. This lab is a great opportunity to learn how to manipulate arrays of objects in JavaScript.
