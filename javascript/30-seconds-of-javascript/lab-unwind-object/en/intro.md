# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `unwind` function in JavaScript. The purpose of this function is to produce an array of objects from an object and one of its array-valued properties. By using object destructuring and `Array.prototype.map()`, we can create an array of objects where each object contains the original object's values, except for the specified key which is mapped to its individual values. Through this lab, we will gain a deeper understanding of how to manipulate and extract data from objects in JavaScript.
