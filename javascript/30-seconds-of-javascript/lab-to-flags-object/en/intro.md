# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert an array of strings into an object mapping to `true`. We will utilize the powerful `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to achieve this. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently transform an array of strings into an object with key-value pairs, making it easier to work with data in your JavaScript applications.
