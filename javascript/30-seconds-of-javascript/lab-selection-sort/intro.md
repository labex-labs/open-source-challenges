# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the selection sort algorithm and learn how to use it to sort an array of numbers in JavaScript. This lab aims to provide a hands-on experience with selection sort and help you understand how it works under the hood. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of selection sort and be able to apply it to solve sorting problems in your future projects.
