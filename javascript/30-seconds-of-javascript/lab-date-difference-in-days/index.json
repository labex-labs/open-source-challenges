  "description": "In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the difference (in days) between two given dates using JavaScript. We will use the `Date` object and write a function that subtracts the initial date from the final date and divides the result by the number of milliseconds in a day. This lab will help you understand how to work with dates in JavaScript and perform date calculations efficiently.",
