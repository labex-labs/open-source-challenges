# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of Juxtapose Functions in JavaScript. We will learn how to create a function that takes multiple functions as arguments and returns a new function that applies those functions to the same set of arguments, returning an array of the results. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use Juxtapose Functions to simplify your code and make it more efficient.
