# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to filter out matching array elements using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.includes()` method to find values to exclude and how to implement the `Array.prototype.filter()` method to create a new array that excludes these values. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to filter out specific elements in an array using JavaScript.
