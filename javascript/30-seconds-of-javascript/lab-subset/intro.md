# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a subset of values in one iterable is contained in another iterable. We will use the `Set` constructor and `Array.prototype.every()` to create a function that checks if all values in the first iterable are present in the second iterable. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with sets in JavaScript.
