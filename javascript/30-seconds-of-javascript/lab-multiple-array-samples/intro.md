In this lab, we will explore how to select random elements from an array using JavaScript. We will learn how to shuffle an array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm and use it to randomly select one or more elements from an array. This lab is designed to enhance your understanding of array manipulation and improve your problem-solving skills in JavaScript.
