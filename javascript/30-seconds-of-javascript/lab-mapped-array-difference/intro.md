# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the implementation of the `differenceBy` function in JavaScript. This function allows us to find the difference between two arrays by applying a provided function to each element in both arrays. We will learn how to use `Set`, `Array.prototype.map()`, and `Array.prototype.filter()` to effectively compare and filter arrays based on a specific criterion.
