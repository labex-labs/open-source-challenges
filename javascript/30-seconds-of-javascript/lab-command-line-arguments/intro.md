# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore JavaScript's command-line argument handling mechanism. We will learn how to retrieve the command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script and how to process them. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use command-line arguments in your JavaScript applications.
