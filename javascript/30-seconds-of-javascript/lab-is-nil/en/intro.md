# Introduction

In this lab, we will delve into the concept of checking if a specified value is `null` or `undefined`. We will explore the `isNil()` function, which makes use of the strict equality operator to perform the check, and we will see how it can be used in practical scenarios to improve the reliability and robustness of our code.
