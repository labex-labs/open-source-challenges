# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to attach an event listener to multiple targets using JavaScript. The lab will guide you on how to use the `Array.prototype.forEach()` method and the `EventTarget.addEventListener()` method to attach the provided `listener` for the given event `type` to all the specified `targets`. By the end of this lab, you will have gained the skills to add event listeners to multiple targets with ease.
