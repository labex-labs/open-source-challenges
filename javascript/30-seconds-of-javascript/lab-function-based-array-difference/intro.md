# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to filter out values from an array based on a given comparator function. We will use the `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.findIndex()` methods to achieve this. Additionally, we will learn how to use the default strict equality comparator if no comparator function is provided.
