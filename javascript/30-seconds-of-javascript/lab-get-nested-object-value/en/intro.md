# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to retrieve nested object properties using a given path string in JavaScript. We will learn how to use various array methods such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to extract specific values from complex objects. This skill is essential for working with large datasets and APIs that return nested JSON objects.
