# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a given argument is a readable stream in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `typeof` operator to check the type of the argument and how to access the `_read` and `_readableState` properties of a stream. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with streams in JavaScript.
