# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create n-dimensional arrays with a given value using recursion in JavaScript. We will use the `Array.from()` and `Array.prototype.map()` methods to generate rows where each is a new array initialized using `initializeNDArray()`. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to create multi-dimensional arrays in JavaScript and how to use recursion to accomplish this task.
