# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of converting angles from radians to degrees in JavaScript. You will learn how to use the radian to degree formula and the built-in `Math.PI` constant to convert angles. Through practical exercises, you will gain hands-on experience with this conversion process and enhance your understanding of trigonometry in JavaScript.
