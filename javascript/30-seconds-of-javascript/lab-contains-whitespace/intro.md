# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a given string contains any whitespace characters using regular expressions in JavaScript. The lab will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the `RegExp.prototype.test()` method to check if a string contains any whitespace characters. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to check for whitespace characters in JavaScript strings.
