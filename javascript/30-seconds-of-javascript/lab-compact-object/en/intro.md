# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use recursion to deeply remove all falsy values from an object or array in JavaScript. We will create a function that takes an object or array as input and returns a new, compacted object or array with only truthy values. This technique can be useful for data cleaning and simplification in various programming applications.
