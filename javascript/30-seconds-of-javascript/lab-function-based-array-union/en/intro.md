# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to implement array union based on a function in JavaScript. We will use the provided comparator function to find and return all the elements that exist in any of the two arrays at least once. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use the `Array.prototype.findIndex()` method and the `Set` object to compare and combine arrays.
