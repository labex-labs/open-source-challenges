# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the world of JavaScript programming and explore how to hide specified elements on a webpage using a simple function called `hide`. By leveraging the power of the spread operator and `Array.prototype.forEach()`, we will learn how to apply the `display: none` style to any element we choose, helping us to create cleaner and more dynamic webpages. Get ready to level up your JavaScript skills and take your web development projects to the next level!
