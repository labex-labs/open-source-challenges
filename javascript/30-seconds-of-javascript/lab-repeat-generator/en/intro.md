# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore JavaScript programming concepts and techniques through a series of hands-on exercises. The lab is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript and improve your programming skills by practicing with real-world scenarios. You will work on tasks such as creating functions, working with arrays and objects, and manipulating the DOM to create dynamic web pages. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid foundation in JavaScript programming and be able to apply your knowledge to build more complex applications.
