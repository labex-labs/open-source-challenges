# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to join URL segments and normalize the resulting URL using JavaScript. The lab will guide you through the process of using various regular expressions to remove double slashes, add proper slashes for the protocol, remove slashes before parameters, combine parameters with `'&'`, and normalize the first parameter delimiter. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently join and normalize URL segments using JavaScript.
