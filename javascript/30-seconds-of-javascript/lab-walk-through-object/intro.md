# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of creating a generator function that walks through all the keys of a given object using recursion. The purpose of this lab is to provide a hands-on experience for learners to understand how to use `yield` and `yield*` expressions in combination with `for...of` loops and `Object.keys()` to iterate over object keys and their values. By the end of this lab, learners will have a practical understanding of how to recursively walk through an object and generate an array of keys representing the current path and the corresponding values.
