# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript by creating a function that filters out specified values from an array and mutates the original array. We will make use of built-in Array methods such as `filter()`, `includes()`, and `push()` to achieve this functionality. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
