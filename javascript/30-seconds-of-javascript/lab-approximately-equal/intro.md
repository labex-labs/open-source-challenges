# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to implement a function in JavaScript that checks if two numbers are approximately equal to each other. We will use the `Math.abs()` method to compare the absolute difference between the two values to a specified or default epsilon value. This lab will help us understand how to handle floating-point numbers with precision in JavaScript.
