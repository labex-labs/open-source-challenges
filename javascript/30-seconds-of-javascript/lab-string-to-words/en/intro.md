# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a given string into an array of words using JavaScript. We will use the `String.prototype.split()` method to split the string and the `Array.prototype.filter()` method to remove any empty strings. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript and extract meaningful data from them.
