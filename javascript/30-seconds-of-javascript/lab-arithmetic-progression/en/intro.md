# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of arithmetic progression in JavaScript. We will learn how to create an array of numbers in the arithmetic progression, starting with a given positive integer and up to a specified limit. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the `Array.from()` and `map()` methods to create arrays with desired values in the given range.
