# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to sort an array of objects alphabetically based on a given property using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.sort()` method and the `String.prototype.localeCompare()` method to compare the values for the given property. This will allow us to easily sort the array in ascending or descending order, based on our requirements.
