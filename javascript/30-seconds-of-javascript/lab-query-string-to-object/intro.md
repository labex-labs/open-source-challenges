# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a query string or URL into an object using JavaScript. We will use the `String.prototype.split()` method to extract the parameters from the URL, then create an object using the `URLSearchParams` constructor and convert it into an array of key-value pairs. Finally, we will use `Array.prototype.reduce()` to convert the array into a JavaScript object. This lab will help you understand how to manipulate and extract data from URLs and query strings in JavaScript.
