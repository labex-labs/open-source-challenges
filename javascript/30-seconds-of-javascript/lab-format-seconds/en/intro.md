# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `formatSeconds` function in JavaScript. This function returns the ISO format of a given number of seconds by dividing the seconds into appropriate values for hours, minutes and seconds. We will learn how to use `Array.prototype.map()`, `Math.floor()`, `String.prototype.padStart()` and `Array.prototype.join()` to format and combine the values into a string. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to manipulate and format time data in JavaScript.
