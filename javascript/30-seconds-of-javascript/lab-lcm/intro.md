# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the least common multiple of two or more numbers using JavaScript. We will use the greatest common divisor (GCD) formula and the fact that `lcm(x, y) = x * y / gcd(x, y)` to determine the least common multiple. The GCD formula uses recursion, which we will implement in our code.
