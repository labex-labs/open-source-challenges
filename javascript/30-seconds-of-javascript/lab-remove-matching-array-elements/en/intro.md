# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to remove matching elements from an array using JavaScript. We will be using the `Array.prototype.filter()` method to find the elements that match the given condition and `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to remove them from the original array. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
