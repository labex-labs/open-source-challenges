# Conversion of Miles to Kilometers

To convert miles to kilometers, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use the conversion formula `km = mi * 1.609344`.
3. Implement the formula using the JavaScript code below:

```js
const milesToKm = (miles) => miles * 1.609344;
```

4. Test the function by calling it with the desired number of miles, like this:

```js
milesToKm(5); // ~8.04672
```

This will return the equivalent distance in kilometers.
