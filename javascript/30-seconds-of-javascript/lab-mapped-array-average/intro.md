# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of mapping and reducing arrays in JavaScript. Specifically, we will learn how to use the `averageBy()` function to calculate the average of an array after mapping each element to a value using a provided function. Through hands-on exercises and examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of these powerful array methods and how they can be used to streamline our code.
