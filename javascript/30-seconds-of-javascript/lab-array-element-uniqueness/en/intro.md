# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking whether all elements in an array are unique using JavaScript. We will use the `Set` object to eliminate duplicate elements and compare the length of the unique values to the original array. This lab will provide a hands-on experience on how to check for unique elements in an array using JavaScript.
