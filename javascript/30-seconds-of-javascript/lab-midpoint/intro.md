# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of calculating the midpoint between two pairs of (x,y) points using JavaScript. We will learn how to destructure an array to obtain the x and y coordinates of the endpoints and calculate the midpoint for each dimension by dividing the sum of the two endpoints by 2. This lab is designed to enhance our understanding of basic math operations in JavaScript and apply them to solve real-world problems.
