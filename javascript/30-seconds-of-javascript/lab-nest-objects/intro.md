# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function called `nest` that recursively nests objects linked to one another in a flat array. The function uses recursion, `Array.prototype.filter()`, and `Array.prototype.map()` to filter and nest the items based on their `id` and `parent_id` properties. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use recursion to create nested objects in JavaScript.
