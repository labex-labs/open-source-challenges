# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a new array out of the two supplied by generating every possible pair from the elements of the two arrays. We will use JavaScript's built-in methods such as `reduce()`, `map()`, and `concat()` to achieve this. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to work with arrays in JavaScript.
