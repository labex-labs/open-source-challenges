# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use JavaScript to find all the ancestors of an element up until a specified element using the `getParentsUntil()` function. We will learn how to traverse the ancestor tree of an element, add each new ancestor to an array, and use the `matches()` method to check if the current element matches a specified selector. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
