# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to rename object keys in JavaScript. The lab will cover how to use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` in combination with the spread operator to get an object's keys and rename them according to a provided mapping. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to effectively rename object keys in your JavaScript code.
