# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to sort characters in a string in alphabetical order using JavaScript. We will use the spread operator, `Array.prototype.sort()`, and `String.prototype.localeCompare()` to achieve this. By the end of the lab, you will have a good understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript using these methods.
