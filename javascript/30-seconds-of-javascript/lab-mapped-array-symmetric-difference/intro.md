# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the concept of symmetric difference and how it can be implemented in JavaScript using the `symmetricDifferenceBy()` function. We will explore how this function can be used to find the unique values between two arrays after applying a provided function to each element of both arrays. This lab is designed to help you better understand this powerful JavaScript method and how it can be used in your own projects.
