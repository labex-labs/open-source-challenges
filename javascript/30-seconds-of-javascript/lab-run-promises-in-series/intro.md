# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to run an array of promises in series using JavaScript. We will be using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to create a promise chain, where each promise returns the next promise when resolved. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to execute promises sequentially, taking your programming skills to the next level.
