# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `Function Arity` concept in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to create a higher-order function that accepts a function and a number `n` as arguments and returns a new function that only accepts up to `n` arguments, ignoring any additional ones. This will help us understand how to limit the number of arguments passed to a function in JavaScript.
