# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking if a number has any decimal digits using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by one and return the result. Through practical examples and exercises, we will gain a better understanding of how to implement this concept in our JavaScript programs.
