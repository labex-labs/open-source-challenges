# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into a JavaScript programming challenge where we will be tasked with creating a function that returns the maximum value of an array, after mapping each element to a value using the provided function. By using `Array.prototype.map()` and `Math.max()`, we will be able to efficiently achieve this task and gain a better understanding of these essential JavaScript methods.
