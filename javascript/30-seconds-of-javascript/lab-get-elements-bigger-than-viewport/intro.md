# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to identify HTML elements whose width is larger than the viewport's using JavaScript. This can be useful when dealing with responsive design and ensuring that all elements fit within the viewport. By using `HTMLElement.offsetWidth` and `Array.prototype.filter()`, we will be able to quickly and easily filter out elements that exceed the viewport width.
