# How to Find the Most Frequent Element in an Array using JavaScript

To find the most frequent element in an array using JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to map unique values to an object's keys, adding to existing keys every time the same value is encountered.
3. Use `Object.entries()` on the result in combination with `Array.prototype.reduce()` to get the most frequent value in the array.
4. Here is the code to find the most frequent element in an array:

   ```js
   const mostFrequent = (arr) =>
     Object.entries(
       arr.reduce((a, v) => {
         a[v] = a[v] ? a[v] + 1 : 1;
         return a;
       }, {}),
     ).reduce((a, v) => (v[1] >= a[1] ? v : a), [null, 0])[0];
   ```

5. You can test the code using the following example:

   ```js
   mostFrequent(["a", "b", "a", "c", "a", "a", "b"]); // 'a'
   ```

By following these steps, you can easily find the most frequent element in an array using JavaScript.
