# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to find the most frequent element in an array using JavaScript. We will use the `reduce()` method to map unique values to an object's keys and then use `Object.entries()` and `reduce()` to determine the most frequent value in the array. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to efficiently find the most frequent element in an array.
