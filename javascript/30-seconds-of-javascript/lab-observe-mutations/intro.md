# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about observing mutations on a specified element using the `MutationObserver` API in JavaScript. We will create a function that takes an element, a callback function, and options as arguments, and runs the callback for each mutation that is observed on the element. This lab will provide hands-on experience in working with the `MutationObserver` API and understanding how to track changes made to the DOM.
