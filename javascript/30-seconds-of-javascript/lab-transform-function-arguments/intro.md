# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the use of the `overArgs` function in JavaScript. The function allows us to transform arguments before passing them to another function. We will learn how to use `overArgs` to simplify code and increase reusability by creating a new function that invokes an existing function with transformed arguments.
