# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of iterators and generators in JavaScript. Specifically, we will be focusing on creating a flat iterator that can iterate over nested arrays and sets, and flatten them into a single iterable. This will allow us to efficiently access and manipulate nested data structures in a more streamlined manner. By the end of the lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how generators and iterators work, and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.
