# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to retrieve nested values from a JSON object based on an array of keys. We will be using the `reduce()` method to traverse the object's nested structure and retrieve the target value. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to access specific values within a complex JSON object.
