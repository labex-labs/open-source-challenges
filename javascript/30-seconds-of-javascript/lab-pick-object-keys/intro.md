# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `pick` function in JavaScript to extract specific key-value pairs from an object. We will learn how to pass an object and an array of keys to the `pick` function and how it uses `Array.prototype.reduce()` to filter and return only the specified key-value pairs from the object. This lab will help you understand how to work with objects in JavaScript and how to extract only the necessary information from them.
