# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `Set` constructor and `Array.prototype.every()` method to determine if one iterable is a superset of another. The lab will walk you through the creation of a function that checks if the first iterable contains all the elements of the second iterable, excluding any duplicates. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with sets in JavaScript.
