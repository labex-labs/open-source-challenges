# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to group array elements based on their position in the original arrays. We will be using the `zip()` function which takes in multiple arrays and returns a new array containing sub-arrays of elements from each input array, grouped by their position. This is a useful technique in data processing and analysis, and can be used to combine data from multiple sources into a single data structure for further analysis.
