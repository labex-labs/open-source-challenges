# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of Euclidean Distance and implement a function that calculates the distance between two points in any number of dimensions. We will use JavaScript and some built-in methods such as `Object.keys()` and `Math.hypot()` to create the function. This lab will provide a hands-on experience in working with mathematical calculations and JavaScript methods.
