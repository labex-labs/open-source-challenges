# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that checks whether the bottom of a web page is visible or not. This function is useful for implementing features that load new content or trigger actions when a user reaches the end of a page. By understanding how to check for the visibility of the bottom of a page, you will be able to create more engaging and interactive web experiences for your users.
