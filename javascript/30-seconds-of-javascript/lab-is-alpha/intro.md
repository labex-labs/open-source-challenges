# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to determine if a given string contains only alphabetic characters using JavaScript. We will use a regular expression pattern to test the input string and return a boolean value indicating whether the string contains only alphabetic characters or not. This lab aims to help you strengthen your understanding of regular expressions and their usage in JavaScript.
