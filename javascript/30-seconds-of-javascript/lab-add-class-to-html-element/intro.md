# Introduction

In this lab, we will be diving into the world of JavaScript programming by exploring various concepts and techniques used in the language. Through hands-on exercises and practical examples, you will learn how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), work with arrays and objects, use functions and control structures, and much more. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of JavaScript and be able to apply it to your own projects.
