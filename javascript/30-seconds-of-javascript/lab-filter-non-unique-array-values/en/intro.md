# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to filter out non-unique values from an array using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Set` constructor and the spread operator to create an array of unique values, and then use the `Array.prototype.filter()` method to filter out the non-unique values. This lab will help us understand how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript and improve our problem-solving skills.
