# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of flipping function arguments in JavaScript. We will learn how to take a function as an argument and rearrange the arguments so that the first argument becomes the last. Through this exercise, we will gain a better understanding of argument destructuring, closures, and variadic arguments in JavaScript.
