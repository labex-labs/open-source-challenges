# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of getting selected text in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Window.getSelection()` and `Selection.toString()` methods to retrieve the currently selected text on a web page. By the end of this lab, you will be able to implement this feature in your own JavaScript projects and enhance the user experience on your website.
