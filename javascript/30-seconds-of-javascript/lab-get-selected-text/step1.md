# Retrieving Selected Text

To retrieve the currently selected text, use the following code snippet:

```js
const getSelectedText = () => window.getSelection().toString();
```

You can call the `getSelectedText` function to retrieve the selected text, which will be returned as a string. For example:

```js
getSelectedText(); // 'Lorem ipsum'
```

To get started with coding practice, open the Terminal/SSH and type `node`.
