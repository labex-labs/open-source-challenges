# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring JavaScript programming by implementing a function that checks whether all elements in an array are equal. We will be using the `Array.prototype.every()` method to compare the elements of the array with the first element and return a boolean value based on whether they are equal or not. This lab is designed to help you get a better understanding of JavaScript arrays and built-in methods.
