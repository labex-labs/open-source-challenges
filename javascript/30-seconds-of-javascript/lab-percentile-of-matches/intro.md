# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of calculating the percentile of matches in an array using JavaScript. Through the use of the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method, we will develop a function that can determine the percentage of numbers in an array that are less than or equal to a given value. This lab will help to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript array methods and their practical applications.
