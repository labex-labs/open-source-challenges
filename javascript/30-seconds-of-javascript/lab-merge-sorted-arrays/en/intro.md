# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array using JavaScript. We will use the spread operator, `Array.from()`, and the `shift()` method to efficiently merge the arrays. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
