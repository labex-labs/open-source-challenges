# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert an array into an HTML list using JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to use `Array.prototype.map()` and `Document.querySelector()` to create a list of HTML tags and append them to an existing list in your web page. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and create dynamic HTML content.
