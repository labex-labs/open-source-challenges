# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring an algorithm that determines whether two arrays have a common item or not. We will be using JavaScript and its built-in data structures to create a function that will take two arrays as input and return a boolean value indicating whether they intersect or not. This lab will help you improve your problem-solving skills and enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms.
