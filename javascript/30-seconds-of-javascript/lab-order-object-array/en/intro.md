# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to sort an array of objects based on the properties and orders provided. We will use the `Array.prototype.sort()` method and the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to achieve this. The lab will provide a practical understanding of how to manipulate arrays of objects in JavaScript.
