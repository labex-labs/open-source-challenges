# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a comma-separated values (CSV) string to a 2D array of objects using JavaScript. We will use various string manipulation methods such as `split()` and `slice()` along with array methods like `reduce()` and `map()` to achieve this conversion. This lab will help you understand how to work with CSV data in JavaScript and how to manipulate it into a format that can be easily processed.
