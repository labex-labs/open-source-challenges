# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a date falls between two other dates using JavaScript. We will use the greater than and less than operators to compare the dates and return a boolean value indicating if the date is between the start and end dates. This technique can be useful in various scenarios such as filtering data based on a date range.
