# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to remove accents from strings using JavaScript. Accented characters can sometimes cause issues when working with strings, such as when comparing or sorting them. By utilizing the `normalize()` and `replace()` methods, we can easily remove these accents and ensure consistent string manipulation in our code. Join us as we dive into this useful technique for string handling in JavaScript.
