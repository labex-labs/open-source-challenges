# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of injecting CSS code into a web page using JavaScript. We will learn how to create a new `style` element and append it to the document head, allowing us to dynamically modify the appearance of the page. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the styles of a web page.
