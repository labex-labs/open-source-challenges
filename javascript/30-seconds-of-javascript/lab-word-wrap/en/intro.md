# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of string manipulation in JavaScript. Specifically, we will be focusing on the `wordWrap` function which allows us to wrap a string to a given number of characters using a string break character. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript to achieve specific formatting requirements.
