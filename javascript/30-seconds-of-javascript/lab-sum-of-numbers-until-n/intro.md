# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of summing all the numbers between 1 and a given number `n`. We will be using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` to calculate the sum of numbers. Through this lab, you will gain a better understanding of how to solve mathematical problems using programming.
