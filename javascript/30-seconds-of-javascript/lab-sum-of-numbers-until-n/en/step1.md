# Function to Calculate Sum of Numbers Until N

To calculate the sum of numbers between 1 and `n`, you can use the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. Here's an example code in JavaScript:

```js
const sumN = (n) => (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
```

To use this function, pass the value of `n` as an argument. For instance, `sumN(100)` will return `5050`. To start practicing coding, open the Terminal/SSH and type `node`.
