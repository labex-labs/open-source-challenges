# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of converting a variadic function into an array function in JavaScript. We will use a closure and the spread operator to map the array of arguments to the inputs of the function. By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a reusable function that accepts an array of arguments instead of individual arguments.
