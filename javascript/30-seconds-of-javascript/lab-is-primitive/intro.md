# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of primitive values in JavaScript. We will learn how to differentiate between primitive and non-primitive values using the `isPrimitive()` function, which compares the passed value with an object created from it. Through a series of exercises, we will gain a deeper understanding of this fundamental concept in JavaScript.
