# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of Cartesian Product and how to calculate it using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.reduce()`, `Array.prototype.map()` and the spread operator (`...`) to generate all possible element pairs from two arrays. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use these methods to calculate the Cartesian Product of two arrays.
