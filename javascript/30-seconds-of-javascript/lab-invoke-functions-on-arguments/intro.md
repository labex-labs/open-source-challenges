# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the functionality of invoking multiple functions on given arguments and returning the results. Specifically, we will create a function that takes in multiple functions and returns a new function that applies each of those functions to the arguments it receives. This will help us better understand the use of `Array.prototype.map()` and `Function.prototype.apply()` in JavaScript.
