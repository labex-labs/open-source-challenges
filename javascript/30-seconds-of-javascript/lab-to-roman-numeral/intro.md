# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to convert an integer to its roman numeral representation using JavaScript. We will use a lookup table to map the integer values to their corresponding roman numerals, and then use the reduce method to iterate over the values and build the roman numeral representation of the input integer. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to manipulate arrays and strings in JavaScript to perform complex tasks.
