# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in JavaScript. We will learn how to sort an array of numbers using this algorithm and understand the logic behind it. By the end of this lab, you will be able to use the insertion sort algorithm to efficiently sort arrays in your JavaScript projects.
