# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to format a number using fixed-point notation without trailing zeros in JavaScript. We will use the `Number.prototype.toFixed()` method to convert the number to a fixed-point notation string, followed by `Number.parseFloat()` to remove any trailing zeros. Finally, we will use a template literal to convert the number to a string. This lab is designed to help you gain a better understanding of how to format numbers in JavaScript using fixed-point notation.
