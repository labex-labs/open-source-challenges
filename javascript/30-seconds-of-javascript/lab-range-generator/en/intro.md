# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a `rangeGenerator` function in JavaScript that generates all values in a given range using a specified step. We will use a `while` loop and the `yield` keyword to return each value and increment by the specified step. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to create custom generators in JavaScript and their practical applications.
