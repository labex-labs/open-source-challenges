# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of inserting values into an array at a specified index using JavaScript. You will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.splice()` method to insert values after a given index with a delete count of `0`. This lab will provide you with hands-on experience in manipulating arrays in JavaScript and help you understand how to mutate the original array while inserting new values.
