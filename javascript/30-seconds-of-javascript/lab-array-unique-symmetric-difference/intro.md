# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of finding unique symmetric difference between two arrays in JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` methods to remove duplicate values from each array and then create a `Set` from the results to obtain the final output. This exercise will help to improve your understanding of array manipulation and Set data structure in JavaScript.
