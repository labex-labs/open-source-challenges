# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the implementation of a JavaScript function called `findKey`. This function is designed to help us find the first key in an object that satisfies a provided testing function. By using `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.find()`, we can efficiently search through the properties of an object and return the desired key.
