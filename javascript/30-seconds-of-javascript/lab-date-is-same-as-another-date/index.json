  "description": "In this lab, we will explore how to check if a date is the same as another date using JavaScript. We will be using the `Date` object and its `toISOString()` method to convert the dates to an ISO string format, which we can then compare for equality using strict equality checking. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to compare dates in JavaScript and ensure they are the same.",
