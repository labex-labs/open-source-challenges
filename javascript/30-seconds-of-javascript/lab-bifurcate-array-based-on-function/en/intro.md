# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to bifurcate an array based on a given filtering function in JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method and the `Array.prototype.push()` method to split the values of the array into two groups based on whether the filtering function returns a truthy value or not. This lab is designed to enhance your understanding of higher-order functions and array manipulation in JavaScript.
