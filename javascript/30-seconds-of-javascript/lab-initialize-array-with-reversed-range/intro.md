# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to initialize an array with reversed range using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Array.from()` and `Array.prototype.map()` methods to create an array that contains numbers in a specified range, but in reverse order. We will also see how to set default values for the `start` and `step` parameters and use them to generate the desired output.
