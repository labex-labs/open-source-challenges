# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to invert an object's key-value pairs without mutating the original object. We will use the `Object.keys()` method and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to invert the object. Additionally, we will learn how to apply a function to the inverted keys and return an array of keys responsible for generating the inverted value.
