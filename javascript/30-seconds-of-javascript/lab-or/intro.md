# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the logical or (`||`) operator in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to understand how the logical or operator works and how it can be used to check if at least one of the given arguments is `true`. Through practical examples, we will learn how to implement the logical or operator in our code.
