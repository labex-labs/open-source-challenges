# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of calculating the distance between two points in JavaScript. We will use the `Math.hypot()` method to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points and implement it in a function. This lab will help you understand how to use mathematical formulas in JavaScript to solve problems.
