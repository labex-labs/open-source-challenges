  "description": "In this lab, we will explore the concept of calculating the distance between two points in JavaScript. We will use the Math.hypot() method to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points and implement it in a function. This lab will help you understand how to use mathematical formulas in JavaScript to solve problems.",
