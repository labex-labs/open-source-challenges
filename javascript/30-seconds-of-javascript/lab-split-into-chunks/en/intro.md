# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to split an array into smaller arrays of a specified size using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.from()` and `Array.prototype.slice()` methods to create a new array that contains the specified number of chunks. We will also learn how to handle cases where the original array cannot be split evenly.
