# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the weighted average of two or more numbers using JavaScript. We will be using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to create the weighted sum of the values and the sum of the weights, and then divide them with each other to get the weighted average. This lab will help you understand the concept of a weighted average and how to implement it in JavaScript.
