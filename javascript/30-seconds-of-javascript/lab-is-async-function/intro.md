# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of asynchronous functions in JavaScript. We will learn how to recognize and differentiate between regular functions and async functions using the `isAsyncFunction()` method. By the end of this lab, you will have a clear understanding of how to work with asynchronous functions and how they can be used to improve the performance of your code.
