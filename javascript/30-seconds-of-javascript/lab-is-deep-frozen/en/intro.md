# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to check if an object is deeply frozen in JavaScript. The lab will guide us through a recursive function that uses `Object.isFrozen()` to determine if an object is frozen and `Object.keys()` with `Array.prototype.every()` to check all keys for deep freezing. By the end of this lab, we will have a better understanding of how to determine the deep freezing status of an object in JavaScript.
