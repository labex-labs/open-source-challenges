# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to pull matching values from an array and return the removed elements. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.filter()`, `Array.prototype.includes()`, and `Array.prototype.push()` methods to filter out the values specified in the pull array and mutate the original array. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
