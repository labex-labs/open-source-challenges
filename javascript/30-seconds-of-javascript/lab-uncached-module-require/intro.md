# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of caching in Node.js and learn how to remove a module from the cache using the `requireUncached` function. We will also learn how to load a fresh version of the module using `require()` after removing it from the cache. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how caching works in Node.js and be able to use this knowledge to optimize your applications.
