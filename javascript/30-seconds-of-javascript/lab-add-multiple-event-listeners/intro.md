# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of adding multiple event listeners to an element using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.forEach()` method to iterate over an array of event types and the `EventTarget.addEventListener()` method to attach multiple event listeners to an element. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently add multiple event listeners with the same handler to any element on your web page.
