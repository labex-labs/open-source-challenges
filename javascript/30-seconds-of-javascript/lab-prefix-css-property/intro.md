# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `prefix()` function to automatically prefix CSS properties based on the current browser. This will allow us to write cleaner and more maintainable CSS code, without worrying about cross-browser compatibility issues. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use this function in your web development projects.
