# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a string into title case using JavaScript. We will use regular expressions to split the string into words and then capitalize the first letter of each word. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript and apply this technique to format text in your web applications.
