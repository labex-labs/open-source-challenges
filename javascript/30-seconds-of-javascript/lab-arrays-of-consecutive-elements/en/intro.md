# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to find all arrays of consecutive elements in a given array using JavaScript. We will learn how to use `Array.prototype.slice()` and `Array.prototype.map()` methods to extract and map elements of an array to create arrays of `n` consecutive elements. This lab will help you improve your understanding of JavaScript array manipulation and functional programming concepts.
