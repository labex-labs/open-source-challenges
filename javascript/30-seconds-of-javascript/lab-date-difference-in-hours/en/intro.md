# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the difference in hours between two given dates using JavaScript. We will write a function that takes in two `Date` objects and returns the difference between them in hours. This lab will help you improve your JavaScript skills and give you a better understanding of date and time calculations in JavaScript.
