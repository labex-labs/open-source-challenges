# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of generating the Fibonacci sequence using JavaScript. We will be using the `Array.from()` method, along with `reduce()` and `concat()` methods to create an array that contains the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. By the end of the lab, you will have a deeper understanding of these methods and how they can be used to generate the Fibonacci sequence in JavaScript.
