# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that assigns default values for object properties. This function helps streamline the process of ensuring that all properties in an object have a value, even if they were originally undefined. By using the `Object.assign()` method and spread syntax, we can easily create a new object with default values while maintaining the original key order.
