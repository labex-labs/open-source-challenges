# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to map the values of an array to an object using a function in JavaScript. The lab will walk you through the process of using `Array.prototype.reduce()` to apply a function to each element in an array and combine the results into an object. You will also learn how to use the element as the key and the result of the function as the value for each property.
