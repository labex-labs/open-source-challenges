# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of reversing a number in JavaScript. We will learn how to use built-in methods such as `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` to achieve this task. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to manipulate numbers in JavaScript.
