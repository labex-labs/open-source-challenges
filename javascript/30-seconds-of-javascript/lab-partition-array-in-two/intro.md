# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to partition an array into two separate arrays based on a provided function's truthiness for each element using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to create two arrays and the `Array.prototype.push()` method to add elements to the appropriate array based on the provided function's truthiness. By the end of this lab, you will have a strong understanding of how to partition an array in JavaScript and be able to apply this knowledge in your future projects.
