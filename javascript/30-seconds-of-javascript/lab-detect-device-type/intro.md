In this lab, we will be exploring the fundamentals of JavaScript programming. The lab is designed to provide hands-on experience in writing basic JavaScript code, including variables, functions, and conditional statements. By the end of the lab, participants will have a solid foundation in JavaScript programming and be able to apply their knowledge to create simple interactive web applications.
