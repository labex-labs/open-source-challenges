# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to split a multiline string into an array of lines using JavaScript. We will use the `String.prototype.split()` method and a regular expression to match line breaks and create an array of individual lines. This will be a useful skill for parsing and manipulating text data in web development projects.
