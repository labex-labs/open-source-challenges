# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about the `callOrReturn` function, which is a useful utility function in JavaScript. This function can be used to determine whether the given argument is a function or not. If the argument is a function, it will be called with the rest of the arguments. Otherwise, it will simply return the given argument. By the end of this lab, you will be able to use this function to simplify your code and improve its readability.
