# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of finding the symmetric difference between two arrays in JavaScript. This lab will guide you through the process of creating a `Set` from each array to get the unique values and using the `filter()` method to only keep values not contained in the other. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement this logic and be able to apply it to your own projects.
