# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of initializing and filling an array with values generated by a function until a specific condition is met. We will be using the `initializeArrayUntil` function which takes two arguments: `conditionFn` and `mapFn`. Through this lab, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to use this function to generate arrays with custom values and conditions.
