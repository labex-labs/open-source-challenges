# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that checks whether a provided value is of a specified type. We will use the `is()` function, which leverages the `constructor` property and `Array.prototype.includes()` method to determine if the value is of the specified type. This lab will help you gain a better understanding of type checking in JavaScript.
