# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of pluralizing strings in JavaScript. You will learn how to use a closure to define a function that can return the singular or plural form of a word based on an input number. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to practice using optional arguments and dictionaries to customize the behavior of the function. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to handle pluralization in your JavaScript projects.
