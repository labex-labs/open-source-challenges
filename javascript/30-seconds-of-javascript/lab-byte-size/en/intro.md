# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the byte size of a given string using JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to convert a string into a `Blob` object and obtain its size in bytes using the `Blob.size` property. This knowledge can be useful in various scenarios, such as when working with network requests or file uploads, where byte size is an essential factor to consider.
