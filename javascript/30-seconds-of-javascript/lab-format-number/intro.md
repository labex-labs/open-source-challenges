# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to format numbers using the local number format order in JavaScript. We will use the `Number.prototype.toLocaleString()` method to convert a given number to the local number format using separators such as commas and periods. By the end of this lab, you will have a clear understanding of how to format numbers in different locales.
