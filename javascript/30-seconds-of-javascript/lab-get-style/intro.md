# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the fundamentals of JavaScript programming by implementing a variety of exercises and challenges. Through this hands-on experience, we will learn about variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more. By the end of the lab, we will have gained a solid foundation in JavaScript and be able to apply these skills to develop dynamic and interactive web applications.
