# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of higher-order functions in JavaScript and learn how to use them to create more flexible and reusable code. Specifically, we will focus on the `when` function, which takes a condition and a callback function as arguments and returns a new function that applies the callback only when the condition is met. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of functional programming principles and how to apply them in your JavaScript projects.
