# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of removing elements from an array in JavaScript. We will use the `slice()` method to create a new array with a specified number of elements removed from the beginning. Through this lab, you will learn how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript and gain a deeper understanding of how the `slice()` method works.
