# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that fetches all images from within an HTML element and puts them into an array. We will use the `Element.getElementsByTagName()` method and `Array.prototype.map()` to map every `src` attribute of each image element. Additionally, we will learn how to eliminate duplicates and return the final array of images.
