# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert an array into an identity object using JavaScript. We will be using the `Array.prototype.map()` method to create an array of key-value pairs, and then we will use the `Object.fromEntries()` method to convert this array into an object. This lab will help you understand how to manipulate arrays and objects in JavaScript and how to use these methods to create new objects.
