# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to check if a target value exists in a JSON object using JavaScript. We will be using the `hasKey()` function which allows us to sequentially check the keys in the object to determine if the target value is present. This lab will provide a better understanding of how to work with JSON objects in JavaScript.
