# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of date and time manipulation in JavaScript. We will be focusing on a specific function, `quarterOfYear`, which takes in a date and returns the quarter and year to which the date belongs. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to extract and manipulate date and time information in JavaScript.
