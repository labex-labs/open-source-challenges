# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `reduceSuccessive()` function to apply a given function against an accumulator and each element in an array, returning an array of successively reduced values. We will learn how to use `Array.prototype.reduce()` to apply the function to the array, and store each new result. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use these methods to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
