  "description": "In this lab, we will explore how to use the logical or operator to combine two functions and check if at least one of them returns `true` for a given set of arguments. We will learn how to define a higher-order function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that performs the logical or operation on the results of the input functions. Through examples and exercises, we will gain a better understanding of how to use the logical or operator to write more concise and efficient code.",
