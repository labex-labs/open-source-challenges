# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to create a promise that resolves to a given value after a specified amount of time using JavaScript. We will use the `Promise` constructor to create a new promise and the `setTimeout()` method to delay the resolution of the promise. This skill is essential when working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
