# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to deep freeze an object in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Object.freeze()` method recursively to freeze all properties of an object, making it immutable. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to prevent modifications to objects and ensure data integrity in your JavaScript code.
