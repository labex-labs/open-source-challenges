# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a new array by dropping elements from the left of an existing array using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.slice()` method to remove a specified number of elements from the left of an array and how to set a default value for the number of elements to remove. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
