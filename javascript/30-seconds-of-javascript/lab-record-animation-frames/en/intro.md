# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the use of recursion and the `Window.requestAnimationFrame()` method to create a function that can record animation frames and invoke a provided callback on each frame. We will also learn how to control the recording manually using the `start` and `stop` methods of the returned object. This lab will help us understand how to work with animation frames in JavaScript and how to create more efficient and controlled animations.
