# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to ungroup elements in an array of arrays using JavaScript. We will use a combination of built-in JavaScript functions such as `reduce`, `map`, and `forEach` to extract individual arrays from a single array of arrays. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript to achieve the desired output.
