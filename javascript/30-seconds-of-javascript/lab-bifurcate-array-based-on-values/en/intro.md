# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to bifurcate an array based on given values using JavaScript. The lab will demonstrate how to use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method and `Array.prototype.push()` method to add elements to two groups, based on a given filter. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
