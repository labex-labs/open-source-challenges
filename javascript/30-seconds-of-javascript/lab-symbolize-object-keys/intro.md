# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to convert object keys to symbols using JavaScript. We will use the `Object.keys()` method to get the keys of an object and then use `Array.prototype.reduce()` with the `Symbol` method to create a new object with symbolized keys. This technique can be useful in scenarios where we need unique and immutable keys for our objects.
