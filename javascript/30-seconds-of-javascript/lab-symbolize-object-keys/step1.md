# How to Symbolize Object Keys in JavaScript

To symbolize object keys in JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use the `Object.keys()` method to get the keys of the object you want to symbolize.
3. Use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method and `Symbol` to create a new object where each key is converted to a `Symbol`.
4. Here's an example code snippet:

```js
const symbolizeKeys = (obj) =>
  Object.keys(obj).reduce(
    (acc, key) => ({ ...acc, [Symbol(key)]: obj[key] }),
    {}
  );
```

5. To test the function, call `symbolizeKeys()` with your object as the argument, like this:

```js
symbolizeKeys({ id: 10, name: "apple" });
// { [Symbol(id)]: 10, [Symbol(name)]: 'apple' }
```

By following these steps, you can easily symbolize the keys of any object in JavaScript.
