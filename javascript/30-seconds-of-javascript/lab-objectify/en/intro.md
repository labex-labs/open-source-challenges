# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to map an object array to an object using the provided mapping functions. We will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to map the array, and the `mapKey` and `mapValue` functions to map the keys and values of the resulting object respectively. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to transform data structures in JavaScript.
