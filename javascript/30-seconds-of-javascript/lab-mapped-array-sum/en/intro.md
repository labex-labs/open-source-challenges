# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of mapped array sum in JavaScript. The lab aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how to calculate the sum of an array by mapping each element to a value using the provided function. By the end of this lab, learners will be able to use `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to implement the mapped array sum in their JavaScript projects.
