# How to Calculate Logarithm in a Specific Base

To calculate the logarithm of a given number in a specific base, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal or SSH.
2. Type `node` to start practicing coding.
3. Use the following code to calculate the logarithm:

```js
const logBase = (n, base) => Math.log(n) / Math.log(base);
```

4. Replace `n` with the given number and `base` with the specific base.
5. Run the code to get the result.

Here are some examples:

```js
logBase(10, 10); // 1
logBase(100, 10); // 2
```
