# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of logarithms in specific bases in JavaScript. We will learn how to calculate the logarithm of a given number in a specific base using the `Math.log()` function and some basic math operations. Through this lab, we will gain a better understanding of logarithmic functions and how to implement them in our JavaScript programs.
