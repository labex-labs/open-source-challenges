# Introduction

In this lab, we will focus on creating a JavaScript function that checks whether a given value is a number. We will make use of the `typeof` operator and a safeguard against `NaN` to ensure that the function returns `true` only for valid numbers. This lab will help you improve your understanding of JavaScript data types and type checking.
