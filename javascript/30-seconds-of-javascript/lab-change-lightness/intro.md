# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to change the lightness of an `hsl()` color string using JavaScript. By leveraging string manipulation, array methods, and mathematical functions, we will learn how to modify the lightness value while ensuring that it stays within the valid range of `0` to `100`. This skill will come in handy when developing web applications that require dynamic color manipulations based on user interactions.
