# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to add an event listener to an element in JavaScript. The lab will cover the use of `EventTarget.addEventListener()` to attach an event listener to an element, and how to use event delegation to handle events for child elements. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to add event listeners to elements in your web applications.
