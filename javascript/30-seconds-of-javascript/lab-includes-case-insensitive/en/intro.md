# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to perform a case-insensitive substring search in JavaScript. We will use the `RegExp` constructor and the `'i'` flag to create a regular expression that can match the given search string, ignoring the case. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to search for substrings without having to worry about case-sensitivity.
