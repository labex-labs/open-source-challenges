# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of removing array elements until a certain condition is met. We will be using the `takeUntil` function, which loops through an array and removes elements until a specified condition is true. Through this lab, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
