# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Array Similarity algorithm, which is used to find common elements between two arrays. Through this lab, you will learn how to use built-in JavaScript methods like `Array.prototype.includes()` and `Array.prototype.filter()` to compare arrays and extract their common elements. This algorithm is a useful tool for developers when working with large datasets and analyzing data.
