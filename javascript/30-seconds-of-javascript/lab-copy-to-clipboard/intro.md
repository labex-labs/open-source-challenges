# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore JavaScript programming concepts and practice implementing them through hands-on exercises. The lab is designed to help participants develop a strong foundation in JavaScript and gain practical experience in solving coding challenges. By the end of the lab, participants will have gained valuable skills and knowledge that will enable them to build dynamic and interactive web applications.
