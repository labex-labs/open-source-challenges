# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `findFirstN()` function in JavaScript. This function is used to find the first `n` elements in an array for which a given function returns a truthy value. We will learn how to use `findFirstN()` in combination with other array methods to manipulate and extract specific data from arrays.
