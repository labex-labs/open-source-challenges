In this lab, we will delve into JavaScript programming and explore the concept of finding the last matching value in an array. This lab provides an opportunity to enhance your understanding of JavaScript array methods and functional programming techniques. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.pop()` methods to find the last element that meets a certain condition.
