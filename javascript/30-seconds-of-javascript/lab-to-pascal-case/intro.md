# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a string to Pascal case using JavaScript. Pascal case is a naming convention where each word in a multi-word identifier begins with an uppercase letter, and the remaining letters are lowercase. This lab will provide step-by-step guidance on how to use regular expressions and array methods to transform a string to Pascal case.
