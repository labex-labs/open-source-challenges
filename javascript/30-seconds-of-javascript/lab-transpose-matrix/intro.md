# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of transposing a two-dimensional array in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.map()` method to create a transpose of the given array. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to manipulate two-dimensional arrays in JavaScript.
