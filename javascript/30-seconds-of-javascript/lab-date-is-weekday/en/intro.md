# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into JavaScript programming and learn how to work with dates and weekdays. Specifically, we will explore how to use the `Date` object in JavaScript to check whether a given date is a weekday or not. By the end of this lab, you will be able to write a function that determines if a date is a weekday or not, based on the day of the week.
