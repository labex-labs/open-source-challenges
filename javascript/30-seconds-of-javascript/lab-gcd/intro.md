# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of finding the greatest common divisor between two or more numbers/arrays using JavaScript. The lab will introduce a function that uses recursion to calculate the GCD, with a base case of zero. By the end of the lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement this function in your own JavaScript projects.
