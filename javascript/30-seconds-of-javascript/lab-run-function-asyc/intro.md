# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to execute long-running functions asynchronously by using a Web Worker. The purpose of the lab is to teach developers how to run functions in a separate thread, allowing them to avoid blocking the UI while the function is executing. The lab provides a practical example of how to create a Web Worker and use it to run a function.
