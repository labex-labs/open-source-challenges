# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to convert a given string to sentence case using JavaScript. Sentence case is where the first letter of the first word is capitalized and the rest of the words are in lowercase, except for proper nouns. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement this functionality in your own projects.
