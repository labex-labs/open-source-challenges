# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking whether a given number falls within a specified range. We will use arithmetic comparison to check if the number is in the range and handle cases where the end of the range is not specified. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to check if a number is within a given range in JavaScript.
