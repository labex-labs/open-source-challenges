# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if process arguments contain flags using JavaScript. You will learn how to use the `Array.prototype.every()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` methods to check if the specified flags are present in the `process.argv` array. Additionally, you will learn how to use regular expressions to prefix the specified flags with `-` or `--` as needed. This lab will help you improve your understanding of JavaScript and how to work with command-line arguments in Node.js.
