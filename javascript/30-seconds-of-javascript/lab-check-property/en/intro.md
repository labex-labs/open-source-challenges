# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `checkProp` function in JavaScript. This function takes in a predicate function and a property name, and returns a curried function that checks if the property value satisfies the predicate for a given object. We will learn how to use this function to efficiently validate object properties and create flexible and reusable code.
