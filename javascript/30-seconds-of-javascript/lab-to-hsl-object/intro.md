# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to convert an `hsl()` color string to an object with individual values for hue, saturation, and lightness. We will be utilizing string manipulation and array methods to extract the numeric values and store them into a new object with named properties. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with color values in JavaScript.
