# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of negating a predicate function in JavaScript. We will learn how to create a higher-order function that takes a predicate function and returns a new function that negates the original function's output. Through practical examples, we will see how this technique can be useful in filtering arrays or validating input.
