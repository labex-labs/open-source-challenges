# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that returns the head of an array. The function checks if the input array is valid and returns the first element if it exists, otherwise it returns undefined. Through this lab, you will gain a better understanding of array manipulation in JavaScript and learn how to handle edge cases when working with arrays.
