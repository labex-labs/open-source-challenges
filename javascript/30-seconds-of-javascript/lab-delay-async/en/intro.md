# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to delay the execution of an asynchronous function in JavaScript. By using the `sleep` function and returning a `Promise`, we can put a part of the `async` function to sleep for a certain amount of time, allowing for better control and management of the code's execution. Through practical examples, we will learn how to effectively implement this technique in real-world scenarios.
