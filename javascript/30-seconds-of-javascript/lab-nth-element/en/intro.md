# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the `nthElement` function in JavaScript which returns the nth element of an array. You will learn how to use `Array.prototype.slice()` to extract an element from an array, and how to handle out-of-bound indices gracefully. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of the `nthElement` function and how it can be useful in your JavaScript projects.
