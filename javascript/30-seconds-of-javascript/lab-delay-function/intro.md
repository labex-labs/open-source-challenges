# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the `delay()` function which allows us to delay the execution of a given function by a specified number of milliseconds. This function is useful in scenarios where we need to add a pause in our code execution, for example, when working with animations or performing time-sensitive tasks. Through this lab, we will learn how to use the `delay()` function effectively in our JavaScript code.
