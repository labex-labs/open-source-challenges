# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of deep merging two objects in JavaScript. We will create a function that can take two objects and merge them in a way that allows us to handle keys present in both objects using a custom function. By the end of this lab, you will be able to merge complex objects and combine their values using a custom function.
