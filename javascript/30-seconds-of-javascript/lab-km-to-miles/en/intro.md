# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore JavaScript programming and learn how to write code that converts kilometers to miles. The lab will focus on teaching the formula for the conversion and how to implement it in code using JavaScript. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use JavaScript to perform calculations and solve problems.
