# Kilometers to Miles Conversion

To convert kilometers to miles using code, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use the conversion formula `mi = km * 0.621371`.
3. Write the following code snippet:

```js
const kmToMiles = (km) => km * 0.621371;
```

4. Call the function with the desired kilometer value as an argument, for example:

```js
kmToMiles(8.1); // 5.0331051
```

This will return the converted value in miles.
