# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to create a JavaScript function that swaps the case of a given string. This lab will cover the use of the spread operator, `String.prototype.toLowerCase()`, `String.prototype.toUpperCase()`, and `Array.prototype.map()`. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript.
