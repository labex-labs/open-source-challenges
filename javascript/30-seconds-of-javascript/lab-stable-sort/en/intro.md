# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of stable sorting in JavaScript. Stable sorting is a technique that preserves the order of items in an array when their values are the same. We will use a function that utilizes the `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.sort()` methods to implement stable sorting of an array.
