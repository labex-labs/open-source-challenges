# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the implementation of a debounce function in JavaScript. We will be learning how to delay the execution of a function until a specified amount of time has passed since its last invocation, improving performance and avoiding unnecessary function calls. This is a common technique used in web development to optimize user interface interactions and improve the overall user experience.
