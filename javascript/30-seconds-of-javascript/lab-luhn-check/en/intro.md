# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the implementation of the Luhn Algorithm in JavaScript. The Luhn Algorithm is commonly used to validate identification numbers such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, and National Provider Identifier numbers. Through this lab, you will learn how to split a string, reverse an array, use map(), reduce(), and shift() methods to implement the Luhn Algorithm, and ultimately determine whether a given identification number is valid or not.
