# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to generate a UUID in Node.js. UUIDs are unique identifiers that are commonly used in distributed systems to uniquely identify entities without requiring centralized coordination. We will use the `crypto` module in Node.js to generate a UUID that is compliant with RFC4122 version 4.
