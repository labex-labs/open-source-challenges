# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to calculate the product of two or more numbers/arrays using JavaScript. We will make use of the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to multiply each value with an accumulator, which is initialized with a value of `1`. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use the reduce method to solve problems involving multiplication of values.
