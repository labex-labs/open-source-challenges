# How to Calculate the Product of Numeric Values in JavaScript

To calculate the product of two or more numbers or arrays in JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal/SSH and type `node` to start practicing coding.
2. Use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to multiply each value with an accumulator, which should be initialized with a value of `1`.
3. Define a function called `prod` that takes any number of arguments using the spread operator (`...`). Within the function, apply the `reduce()` method to the spread array of arguments.
4. The function returns the result of the multiplication.

Here's an example of how to use the `prod` function:

```js
const prod = (...arr) => [...arr].reduce((acc, val) => acc * val, 1);

prod(1, 2, 3, 4); // 24
prod(...[1, 2, 3, 4]); // 24
```

In the above example, `prod(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `prod(...[1, 2, 3, 4])` both return `24`.
