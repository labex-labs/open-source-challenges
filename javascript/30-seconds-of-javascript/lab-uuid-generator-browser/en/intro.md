# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to generate a UUID in a browser using JavaScript. A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value used to identify resources in a system in a way that is both unique and universal. By the end of this lab, you will have a clear understanding of how to generate a compliant UUID that can be used in your web applications.
