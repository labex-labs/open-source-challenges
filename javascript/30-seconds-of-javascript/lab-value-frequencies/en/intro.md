# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of creating an object with the unique values of an array as keys and their frequencies as the values. We will achieve this by making use of the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to map unique values to an object's keys, adding to existing keys every time the same value is encountered. Through this lab, we will gain a deeper understanding of the reduce method and how it can be used to solve programming problems efficiently.
