# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring a function that converts a string from camelcase to a more readable format. The `fromCamelCase` function uses regular expressions to break the string into words and add a separator between them. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of regular expressions and how they can be used to manipulate strings.
