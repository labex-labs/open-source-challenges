# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore and practice how to write a performant function that returns the index of the fastest executing function from an array of functions. The lab focuses on using `performance.now()` and `Array.prototype.map()` to measure the execution time of functions accurately and compare them. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to optimize your code for maximum performance.
