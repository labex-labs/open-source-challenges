# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to generate a query string from the key-value pairs of an object using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method on `Object.entries()` to create the query string and determine the appropriate symbol to be used based on the length of the `queryString`. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently generate a query string for your web applications.
