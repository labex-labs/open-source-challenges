# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to hash a string into a whole number using the SDBM algorithm. We will use String.prototype.split() and Array.prototype.reduce() to create a hash of the input string, utilizing bit shifting. The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the concept of hashing and how it can be used to generate unique identifiers for data.
