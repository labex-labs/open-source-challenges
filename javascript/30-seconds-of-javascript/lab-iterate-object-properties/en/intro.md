# Introduction

In this lab, we will be working with iterating over an object's own properties in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to use the `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()` methods to loop through an object's properties and run a callback function for each one. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with objects in JavaScript and how to manipulate their properties.
