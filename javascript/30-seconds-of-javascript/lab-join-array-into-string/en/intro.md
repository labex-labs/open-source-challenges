# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of joining elements of an array into a single string using JavaScript. We will be using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to combine the elements of the array and a separator to specify how the elements should be joined together. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript and create more efficient code.
