# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption algorithm that shifts each letter of a given string by a certain number of positions down the alphabet. We will implement the Caesar cipher in JavaScript, using a combination of string manipulation and array methods, and learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages with this technique. This lab is an excellent opportunity to practice your JavaScript skills and gain a better understanding of encryption algorithms.
