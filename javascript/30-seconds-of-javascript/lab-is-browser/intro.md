# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to determine if the current runtime environment is a browser using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.includes()` method and the `typeof` operator to check for the existence of the `Window` and `Document` globals, which are typically only available in a browser environment. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to write front-end modules that can run on the server without throwing errors.
