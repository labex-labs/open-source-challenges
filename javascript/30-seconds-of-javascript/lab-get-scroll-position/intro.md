# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to determine the current scroll position of a webpage using JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `getScrollPosition` function to get the X and Y coordinates of the scroll position, regardless of whether the user has scrolled using the mouse or keyboard. This knowledge can be useful for implementing various scrolling effects and animations on a webpage.
