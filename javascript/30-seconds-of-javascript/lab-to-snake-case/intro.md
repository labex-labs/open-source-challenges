# Introduction

In this lab, we will delve into the world of JavaScript programming to learn how to convert a given string into snake case. We will use regular expressions and various array methods such as `map()`, `slice()`, and `join()` to break down the string and reconstruct it with underscores as separators. By the end of this lab, you will have a good understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript and apply these concepts to other programming projects.
