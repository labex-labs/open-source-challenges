# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a number into an array of its digits, removing its sign if necessary. We will use a combination of JavaScript's built-in methods, such as `Math.abs()`, spread operator (`...`), `Array.prototype.map()`, and `parseInt()` to achieve this. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with numbers in JavaScript and manipulate them to suit your needs.
