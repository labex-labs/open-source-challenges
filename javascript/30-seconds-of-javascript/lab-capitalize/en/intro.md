# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function called `capitalize` that capitalizes the first letter of a string. The function uses array destructuring and `String.prototype.toUpperCase()` to achieve the desired result. We will also see how to use the `lowerRest` argument to convert the rest of the string to lowercase if needed.
