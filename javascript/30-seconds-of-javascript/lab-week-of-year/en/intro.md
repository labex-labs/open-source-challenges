# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the zero-indexed week of the year that a given date corresponds to using JavaScript. We will use the `Date` constructor and several `Date.prototype` methods to obtain the first Monday of the year and calculate the number of weeks between the first Monday and the given date. This lab is designed to enhance your understanding of JavaScript date manipulation and calculation.
