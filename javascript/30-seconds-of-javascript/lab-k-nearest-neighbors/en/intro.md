# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a powerful tool for classification of data points. By implementing this algorithm in JavaScript, we will be able to classify new data points based on their proximity to existing labeled data points, making it a valuable tool for a variety of applications, such as recommendation systems and image recognition. Through this lab, we will gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning algorithms work and how they can be implemented in real-world scenarios.
