# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to group an array into an object using JavaScript. Specifically, we will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to associate properties to values in an object, given an array of valid property identifiers and an array of values. We will also learn how to handle cases where the length of the two arrays differ. By the end of the lab, you will have gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate objects and arrays in JavaScript.
