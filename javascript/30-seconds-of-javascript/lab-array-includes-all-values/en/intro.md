# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript programming exercise that involves checking if all the elements in a given array are included in another array. Through this exercise, you will learn how to use `Array.prototype.every()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` to solve this problem efficiently. This lab will help you improve your understanding of JavaScript arrays and array methods.
