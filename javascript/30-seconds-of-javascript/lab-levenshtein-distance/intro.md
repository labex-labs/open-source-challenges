# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the Levenshtein Distance algorithm and its implementation in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to understand how to calculate the difference between two strings by measuring the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one string into the other. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm and how to use it in your own JavaScript projects.
