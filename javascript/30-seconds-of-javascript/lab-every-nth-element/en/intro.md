# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of higher-order functions in JavaScript. We will learn how to use built-in higher-order functions such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to manipulate and transform arrays. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of higher-order functions and be able to apply them in your own JavaScript projects.
