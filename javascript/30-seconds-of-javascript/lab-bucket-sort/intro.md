# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the bucket sort algorithm in JavaScript. Bucket sort is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. This lab will provide you with an opportunity to implement this algorithm and gain a deeper understanding of how it works.
