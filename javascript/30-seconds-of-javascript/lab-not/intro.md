# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of the logical not operator in JavaScript. Specifically, we will create a function that takes a boolean value and returns its inverse using the `!` operator. Through this exercise, you will gain a deeper understanding of how logical operations work in JavaScript and how they can be used in everyday programming tasks.
