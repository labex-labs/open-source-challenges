# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `matchesWith` function in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to learn how to compare two objects and determine if they contain equivalent property values based on a provided function. We will be using `Object.keys()`, `Array.prototype.every()`, and `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` to accomplish this task.
