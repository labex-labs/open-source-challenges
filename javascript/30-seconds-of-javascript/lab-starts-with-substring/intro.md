# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if a given string starts with a substring of another string using JavaScript. We will learn how to use `for...in` loop and `String.prototype.slice()` to get each substring of a given word, and `String.prototype.startsWith()` to check if the current substring matches the text. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently find if a string starts with a specific substring in JavaScript.
