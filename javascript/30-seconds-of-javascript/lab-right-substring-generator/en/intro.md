# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of substring generation in JavaScript. We will focus on generating right substrings of a given string using the `for...in` loop and `String.prototype.slice()` method. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript and generate substrings for various use cases.
