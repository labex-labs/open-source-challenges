# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of function composition in JavaScript. We will learn how to combine multiple functions to create a new function, and how to use the `compose()` function to perform right-to-left function composition. Through hands-on examples and exercises, we will gain a deeper understanding of this powerful technique and its practical applications in programming.
