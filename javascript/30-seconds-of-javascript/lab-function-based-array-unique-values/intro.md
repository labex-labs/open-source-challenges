# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that helps find all unique values in an array based on a provided comparator function. We will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` and `Array.prototype.some()` methods to create a new array that contains only the first unique occurrence of each value, based on the provided comparator function. This lab will provide you with a deeper understanding of how to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
