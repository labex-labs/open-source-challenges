# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of finding the vertical offset of an element on a web page. We will be using a JavaScript function that calculates the distance between a given element and the top of the document by looping through its offset parents and adding up the offsets. Through this lab, you will gain a better understanding of how to manipulate and calculate the position of elements on a webpage.
