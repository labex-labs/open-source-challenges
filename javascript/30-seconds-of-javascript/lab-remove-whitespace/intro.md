# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of string manipulation in JavaScript. Specifically, we will focus on removing whitespaces from strings using regular expressions. Through a series of exercises and examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of how to use the `String.prototype.replace()` method to remove whitespace characters and create cleaner, more manageable strings.
