# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of deferring function invocation in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the `setTimeout()` function to defer the execution of a function until the current call stack has cleared. We will also see how this technique can be useful in scenarios where we want to improve the performance and responsiveness of our web applications.
