# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the functionality of Node.js and learn how to determine if our code is running within a Node.js environment. By using the `process` global object, we can check if our code is being executed within a Node.js runtime environment and perform specific actions accordingly. This lab will provide hands-on experience with Node.js and deepen your understanding of its capabilities.
