# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of prime factorization and how it can be implemented in JavaScript using the trial division algorithm. We will learn how to find the prime factors of a given number and build a function that can handle this task. This lab will provide hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the algorithm and its implementation.
