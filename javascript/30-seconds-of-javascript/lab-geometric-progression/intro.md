# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of geometric progression and how it can be implemented in JavaScript. We will learn how to initialize an array with a range of numbers where the ratio between two terms is constant and calculate the length of the array based on the provided arguments. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of geometric progression and how to apply it in your JavaScript projects.
