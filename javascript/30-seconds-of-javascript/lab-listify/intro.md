# Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to map an object to an object array using the `listify()` function in JavaScript. The function uses `Object.entries()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to map the object and `mapFn` to map the keys and values of the object. By the end of this lab, you will be able to efficiently map objects to arrays using JavaScript.
