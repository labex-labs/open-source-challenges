# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to extend a 3-digit color code to a 6-digit color code using JavaScript. We will be using Array methods such as `map()`, `split()`, and `join()` along with `slice()` to remove the `#` from the string start if present. This lab will help you understand how to manipulate strings and arrays in JavaScript to achieve a desired output.
