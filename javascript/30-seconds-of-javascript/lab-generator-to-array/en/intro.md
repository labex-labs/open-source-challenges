# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of generators in JavaScript and how they can be used to simplify the process of iterating over large sets of data. Generators are a powerful tool that allows us to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function that generates successive values. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of generators and how they can be used in your JavaScript code.
