# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of finding the last `n` elements that satisfy a given condition in an array. We will learn how to use a `for` loop to iterate through the array and execute a provided function on each element. We will also learn how to use the `Array.prototype.unshift()` method to prepend matching elements to the results array and return it once the desired length is reached.
