# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate the difference between two arrays without filtering duplicate values. The lab will guide you through the process of creating a `Set` from one array to get the unique values, and then using `Array.prototype.filter()` on the other array to keep only values that are not contained in the `Set`. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with arrays in JavaScript.
