# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of array permutations in JavaScript. We will learn how to use recursion to generate all possible permutations of an array's elements, even if they contain duplicates. We will also understand how to use Array methods such as `map()` and `reduce()` to combine the different permutations into a single array. However, we must keep in mind that executing this function on arrays with more than 8 to 10 elements may significantly increase the execution time and cause the browser to hang.
