# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore and practice using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages. We will learn how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to add, remove, and modify HTML elements and content on a web page. Additionally, we will utilize event listeners to respond to user actions and create interactive experiences.
