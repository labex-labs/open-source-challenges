# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert an array of objects into an object where each object's key is a specified property value of the original objects. We will achieve this by using the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method and object destructuring in JavaScript. This lab will help you gain a deeper understanding of how to manipulate and transform data in JavaScript.
