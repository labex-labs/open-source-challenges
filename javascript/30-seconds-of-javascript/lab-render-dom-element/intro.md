# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use JavaScript to dynamically render DOM elements based on a given tree structure. The `renderElement` function takes in a tree-like object and recursively creates and appends the corresponding DOM elements to the specified container. This is a fundamental skill for building dynamic web applications and can greatly enhance the user experience.
