# Introduction

In this lab, we will delve into the concept of generator functions in JavaScript. We will explore how they differ from regular functions and learn how to identify them using the `isGeneratorFunction()` function. Through practical examples and exercises, you will gain a solid understanding of how generator functions work and their potential applications in your code.
