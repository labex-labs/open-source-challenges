# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to use the `divmod` function in JavaScript to get the quotient and remainder of a division operation. We will learn how to implement this function using the `Math.floor()` and modulo operators, and use it to perform various division operations. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use this function to solve problems involving division in your JavaScript programs.
