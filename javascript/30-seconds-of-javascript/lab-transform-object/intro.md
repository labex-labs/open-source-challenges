# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `transform` function in JavaScript which allows us to apply a specified function against an accumulator and each key in an object. By using `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.reduce()`, we can easily iterate over each key in an object and perform the desired transformation. This lab will provide hands-on experience with this useful function and demonstrate its practical applications in JavaScript programming.
