# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert an integer to a suffixed string with a meridiem suffix in JavaScript. We will use the modulo operator and conditional checks to transform the integer into a 12-hour format with either 'am' or 'pm' added based on its value. This lab will provide a practical exercise in handling time values in JavaScript.
