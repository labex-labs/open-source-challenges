# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring how to create a date range generator using JavaScript. This generator will allow us to easily generate all dates within a specified range using a given step. By using the `Date` constructor and `yield` keyword, we can efficiently iterate over the dates and return them to the user. This lab will be a great opportunity to practice working with loops and dates in JavaScript.
