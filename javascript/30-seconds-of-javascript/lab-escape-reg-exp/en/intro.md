# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of regular expressions in JavaScript and learn how to escape special characters in a string to use in a regular expression. Regular expressions are powerful tools that allow us to manipulate and search for patterns in strings, making them a valuable skill for any JavaScript developer to learn. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use regular expressions and the `escapeRegExp` function to improve your coding skills.
