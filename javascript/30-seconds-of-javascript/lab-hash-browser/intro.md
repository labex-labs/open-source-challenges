# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to calculate a SHA-256 hash in a browser environment using the SubtleCrypto API. We will learn how to create a hash for a given value, generate a digest of the data, and convert the data to its hexadecimal representation. By the end of the lab, we will have a better understanding of how to secure sensitive data in web applications.
