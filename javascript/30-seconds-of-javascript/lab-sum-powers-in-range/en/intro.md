# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that calculates the sum of powers in a given range of numbers. You will learn how to use built-in array methods such as `fill()`, `map()`, and `reduce()` to perform mathematical operations efficiently. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to customize the function's input parameters to suit your needs.
