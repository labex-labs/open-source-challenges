# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to chain asynchronous functions in JavaScript. We will learn how to loop through an array of functions containing asynchronous events and call the `next` function when each event has completed. By the end of the lab, you will be able to efficiently execute a series of asynchronous operations in a specific order.
