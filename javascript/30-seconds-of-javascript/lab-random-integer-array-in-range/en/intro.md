# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to generate a random integer array within a specified range using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.from()` method to create an empty array and fill it with randomly generated integers using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to generate random integers in JavaScript and apply this knowledge to your own projects.
