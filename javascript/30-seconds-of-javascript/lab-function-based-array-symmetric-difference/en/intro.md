# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to find the symmetric difference between two arrays based on a provided function using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.filter()` and `Array.prototype.findIndex()` methods to compare the elements of the two arrays and return the values that are unique to each array. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use these methods to compare and manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
