# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of traversing the node tree upwards in JavaScript by implementing a function that finds the closest matching node to a given node based on a provided selector. This lab aims to enhance your understanding of DOM manipulation and improve your ability to write efficient and effective JavaScript code. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid grasp of how to traverse and manipulate the DOM tree using JavaScript.
