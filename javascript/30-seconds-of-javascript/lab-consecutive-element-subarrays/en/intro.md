# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of creating consecutive element subarrays using JavaScript. The goal of this lab is to learn how to create an array of n-tuples of consecutive elements using the `Array.prototype.slice()` and `Array.prototype.map()` methods in JavaScript. Through practical examples, we will understand how to populate the array with n-tuples of consecutive elements from an input array and return an empty array if n is greater than the length of the input array.
