# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to partition an array based on a provided function using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.reduce()` method to accumulate the partitioned values into an array while checking for changes in the output of the provided function. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to partition arrays in JavaScript.
