# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to add an event listener to an element that will only run the callback function the first time the event is triggered. We'll accomplish this by using the `EventTarget.addEventListener()` method and passing `{ once: true }` as options. This lab will help you understand how to handle events in a more efficient and effective way.
