# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to extract and map URL parameters into a JavaScript object using regular expressions and array methods. We will learn how to use `String.prototype.match()` to obtain all key-value pairs and `Array.prototype.reduce()` to transform them into a single object. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with URLs and extract useful information from them.
