# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of padding a given number to a specified length using JavaScript. We will be using the `String.prototype.padStart()` method to pad the number and convert it to a string. Through this lab, you will gain a better understanding of how to manipulate strings and numbers in JavaScript.
