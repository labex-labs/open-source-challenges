# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert a function that accepts an array into a variadic function using JavaScript. We will achieve this by creating a closure that collects all inputs into an array-accepting function. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate functions in JavaScript to make them more versatile and adaptable to different use cases.
