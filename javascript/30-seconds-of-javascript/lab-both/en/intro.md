# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of higher-order functions in JavaScript. Specifically, we will focus on creating a function that checks if two given functions return true for a given set of arguments using the logical `and` operator. Through this lab, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to manipulate functions in JavaScript and how to use them to write more complex and efficient code.
