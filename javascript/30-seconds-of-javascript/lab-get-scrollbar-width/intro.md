# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore JavaScript programming and its key features. The purpose of this lab is to provide an introduction to JavaScript and enable learners to develop a foundational understanding of the language. Through hands-on exercises, learners will gain practical experience in using JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, and create dynamic web applications. By the end of this lab, learners will be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to begin building their own JavaScript projects.
