# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of counting substrings of a string using JavaScript. We will create a function that takes in a string and a search value and returns the number of times the search value appears in the string. This lab will help you understand the fundamentals of string manipulation in JavaScript and improve your problem-solving skills.
