# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to determine whether a given number is a power of `10` or not using JavaScript. We will use the `Math.log10()` function and the modulo operator to check if the number is a power of `10`. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to work with logarithmic functions and the modulo operator in JavaScript.
