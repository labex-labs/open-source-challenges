# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the implementation of a JavaScript function called `nthArg`, which allows us to retrieve the nth argument of a function. We will learn how to use `Array.prototype.slice()` method to retrieve the desired argument, and also how to handle negative values for `n`. By the end of this lab, we will have a solid understanding of how to use `nthArg` to retrieve arguments from a function.
