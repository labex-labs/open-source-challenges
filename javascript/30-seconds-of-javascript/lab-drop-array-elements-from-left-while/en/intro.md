# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the `dropWhile` function in JavaScript. This function allows us to remove elements from an array based on a specified condition until that condition is no longer met. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use `dropWhile` in your own code to filter and manipulate arrays.
