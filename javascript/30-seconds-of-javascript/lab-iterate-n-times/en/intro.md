# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the `times()` function in JavaScript which iterates over a callback a specified number of times or until it returns `false`. We will learn how to use this function to execute a function repeatedly, and how to pass arguments to the callback function. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to use the `times()` function to make your code more efficient and concise.
