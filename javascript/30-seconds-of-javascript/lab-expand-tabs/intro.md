# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to convert tabs to spaces in a given string using JavaScript. We will use regular expressions and the `String.prototype.repeat()` method to replace each tab character with a specified number of spaces. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to manipulate strings in JavaScript.
