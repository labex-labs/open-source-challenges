# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if two arrays have the same contents in JavaScript. We will create a function that takes in two arrays and returns `true` if they contain the same elements, regardless of order, and `false` otherwise. We will use a combination of `Set`, `for...of` loop, and `Array.prototype.filter()` to achieve this functionality.
