# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the world of JavaScript programming and dive into the concept of functions. Specifically, we will learn how to log the name of a function using the `console.debug()` method and the `name` property of the passed function. This lab will provide hands-on experience in working with functions and debugging tools in JavaScript.
