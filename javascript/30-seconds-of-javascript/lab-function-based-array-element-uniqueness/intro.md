# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into a JavaScript programming concept that involves checking if all elements in an array are unique based on a provided mapping function. This lab will demonstrate how to use `Array.prototype.map()` and `Set` to efficiently check for unique values and compare them to the original array. By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement this logic in your JavaScript projects.
