In this lab, we will explore how to unescape HTML characters using JavaScript. HTML escaping is a common technique used to encode special characters in HTML to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. However, sometimes we need to convert the escaped characters back to their original form. We will learn how to do this by creating a function that unescapes the most common HTML characters.
