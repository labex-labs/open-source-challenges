# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking if an HTML element has a specific class using JavaScript. Through practical examples, we will learn how to use the `Element.classList` and `DOMTokenList.contains()` methods to determine whether a given element contains a specified class or not. This knowledge is essential for web developers who need to manipulate HTML elements dynamically based on their classes.
