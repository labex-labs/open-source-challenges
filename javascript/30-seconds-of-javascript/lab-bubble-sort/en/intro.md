# Introduction

In this lab, we will be working on a JavaScript programming exercise that focuses on sorting arrays using the bubble sort algorithm. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how the bubble sort algorithm works, as well as to give you an opportunity to practice your JavaScript programming skills. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to implement the bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript, and how to use it to sort arrays of numbers.
