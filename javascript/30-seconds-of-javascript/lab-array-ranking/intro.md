# Introduction

In this lab, we will be exploring the concept of array ranking in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to understand how to calculate the ranking of an array based on a comparator function, using techniques such as `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.filter()`. Through practical examples and exercises, you will gain a better understanding of how to implement this functionality in your own JavaScript projects.
