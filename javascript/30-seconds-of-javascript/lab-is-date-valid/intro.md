# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore a JavaScript function that checks whether a given date is valid or not. The function uses the spread operator and the `Date` constructor to create a new `Date` object from the given arguments. It then uses the `valueOf()` method and `Number.isNaN()` to check if the object is valid. This lab is a great opportunity to practice working with JavaScript functions and date objects.
