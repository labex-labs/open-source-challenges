# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of binding object methods in JavaScript. We will create a function that binds a given method of an object to the context of that object, allowing us to call the method with any additional arguments we provide. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to manipulate objects and their methods in JavaScript.
