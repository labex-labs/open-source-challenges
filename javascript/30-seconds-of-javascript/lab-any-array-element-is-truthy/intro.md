# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore how to check if any element in an array is truthy using JavaScript. We will use the `Array.prototype.some()` method and a provided predicate function to test if at least one element in a collection returns `true`. Additionally, we will learn how to use the `Boolean` function as a default argument to simplify the code.
