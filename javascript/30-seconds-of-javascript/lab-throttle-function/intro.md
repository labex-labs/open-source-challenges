# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of throttling in JavaScript. Throttling is the process of limiting the rate at which a function can be executed, to avoid performance issues and excessive resource usage. Through this lab, we will learn how to create a throttled function using setTimeout() and clearTiemout() and how to apply it in a real-world scenario, such as handling events in the browser.
