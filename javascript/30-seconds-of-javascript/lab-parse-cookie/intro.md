# Introduction

In this lab, we will dive into the topic of parsing HTTP cookies in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to provide a hands-on experience of how to extract and organize cookie data from an HTTP header string. By the end of this lab, you will have a clear understanding of how to use the `parseCookie` function to create an object containing all cookie name-value pairs.
