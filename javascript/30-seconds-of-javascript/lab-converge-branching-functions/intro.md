# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of converge branching functions in JavaScript. The purpose of this lab is to help you understand how to create a higher-order function that accepts a list of branching functions and a converging function as arguments and returns a new function that applies each branching function to the arguments and passes the results to the converging function. This technique can be useful in many scenarios where you need to combine multiple functions to produce a final result.
