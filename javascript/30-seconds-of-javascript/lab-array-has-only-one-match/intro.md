# Introduction

In this lab, we will explore the concept of checking if an array has only one match in JavaScript. We will utilize the `Array.prototype.filter()` method to find all matching array elements and then use the `Array.prototype.length` property to determine if only one element matches the given function. By the end of the lab, you will have a better understanding of how to effectively check for a single match in an array using JavaScript.
