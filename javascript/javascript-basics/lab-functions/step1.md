# Functions

> `index.html` have already been provided in the VM.

[Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function) are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions.

For example:

```js
let myVariable = document.querySelector("h1");
```

```js
alert("hello!");
```

These functions, `document.querySelector` and `alert`, are built into the browser.

If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— `()` —it is likely a function. Functions often take [arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Argument): bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.

For example, the `alert()` function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.

You can also define your own functions.

In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:

```js
function multiply(num1, num2) {
  let result = num1 * num2;
  return result;
}
```

Try running this in the console; then test with several arguments. For example:

```js
multiply(4, 7);
multiply(20, 20);
multiply(0.5, 3);
```

> **Note:** The [`return`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) statement tells the browser to return the `result` variable out of the function so it is available to use. This is necessary because variables defined inside functions are only available inside those functions. This is called variable scoping. (Read more about [variable scoping](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#variable_scope).)
